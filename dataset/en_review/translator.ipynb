went to Tokyo by holding an accommodation at Gasai Station and traveling to downtown Tokyo.It is the station of the Tokyo Metro Toga Line in Dogawa -gu, Tokyo.It is broadcasted.The driving speed and the stops of each station are stopped.Including passing on the way) I think there are many options for the transportation to the seven shuttle buses of Doyoung Bus or Keisei Bus. \\ n \\The bus terminal is being built in the form of a nervous form of the vision of Fantasy Line 7. \\ n \\ n is the role of a lot of people who are sick in Eoga and the campus, but the role of JR is the role of JRThere are no nakatenants or department stores, and under the ticket gate on the side of the Otemachi side, small shops and restaurants are continuing the eaves of the metro center Casai.There is a subway museum, which is a small museum, a cheap entrance fee, and a facility that can be enjoyed in the family.It is a great subway station connected directly.All local trains are waiting here for a few minutes so that the express train can pass during the peak time./ Narita Airport, Haneda Airport bus stop is near Kasai Station.(As of September 2023, Mr. Donut's bus stop) \\ N If you live around Egawa Wagua Urayas, Ichikawa, I think it would be convenient to use this bus./ There is a subway museum.Since it was a station, it was mistaken with Nishika in the stamp rally…/It is the station of Tokyo Metro Zay.In the last four months, I had a chance to go to the side of Nishika next to it, but I thought there were similar forms of various commercial facilities around the high -end restaurant.In order to carry out the waiting atmosphere, it seems that it is often arrived 3 minutes earlier than the time written in the visual table.When I went, I chose a curry shop, but in Kasai, I chose the curry shop!\\ n \\ n The taxi rarely comes. \\ N If you burn, it's kind.It is one station (because there is no busy area around Nakihu Nabashi Station), the linkage is…\\ n depends on the person who knows this as \"old\" or \"the old smell.\"\\ n \\ n, for yourself, if you were next to the station, you didn't complain if you were next to the station./Home, passages and stairs are narrow and old for the many people.There is no place to run away, so it is very scary for humans who cannot move at the same speed as the adults of a healthy person.I'm quite worried about using it as a child alone.It's an old station, and it's noticeable.I was surprised that the center in front of the station was Pachinko shop.There is an alternative/I am always using Casai Station, but the response of a man who came to the evening ticket window of this evening was very good.If the seed increases, it may be connected to the image up of the station.I came from the direction of Takadanobaba, but the bus platform 8 and 9 are the nearest exit is the subway museum.However, it seems that I can't go directly from the groove (should I get off the home of the opposite side?).Because it didn't know it, I came out of the central ticket gate and crossed the wide crosswalk.It is very difficult to use because the bus stop is divided by blocking the crosswalk.There is also a closed day, but there is also a subway museum. \\ N The train has a fast passing waiting, so the speed does not stop.Since there is a system, I think the traffic is convenient.There is also a voice and a mood guide. \\ N \\ n There are bank ATMs, coin lockers, courier rockers, ID photos, convenience stores, drinks, vending machines and capsule toys (Gacha).Under the subway museum, Casai Metro Center 1 ~ 2 Avenue, restaurants, clothing shops, 100 yen Shop, quantity, headquarters, flower shop, lottery, lottery, dentistry, convenience store, etc.In front of you, there is a multiple banks, hotels, and many restaurants of business.There are no stylish cafes, but there are torics and recently made Komeda coffee shops.I think it's a station.I used to take the son of 3 years old.There are no restaurants in the station, but there are various stores such as banks, convenience stores, and fast foods.Only the speed is stopped. \\ N There are many restaurants around the station, and there is a subway museum under the high price.There is a wide rotari in front of the station.In the station of each station, they often arrive about three minutes faster than the time written in the timetable to carry out the waiting for the passing of the speed.The closest station of the subway museum ./ It is helpful when it is cold because there is a waiting room. \\ N's chairs in the waiting room are easy to get up because of shallow depth.There is a place where you can get lost items in addition to the N ticket gate, but there is a staircase here \\ n and the courier's recipient locker, there is an ATM of the post office and Mizuho Bank, so I think it is convenient for life.Many buses are stopping.The station is crowded, but if it's a little far, it's a quiet residential area.The subway museum is almost in front of the station.The next seven minutes arrive in 7 minutes, but only 59 minutes is always one minute, so I think it's a good idea to change to 58 minutes.Stamp Rally is held (^^)/It is one of Tokyo Metro Jaisun's ground station located at 5 seconds of Tokyo, Tokyo.Since our station is the closest station to the subway museum, the name of the subway museum is introduced.\\ N \\ n, like the Izumi Tamagawa and Umega Oka Station on the Odakyu Line, the center of the line is used with a rapid train passing through the station, and there is a relative home on the outside of the track.Each station stops of each station, a fast passing waiting for the station. \\ N \\ n near Uratas of Home, there is a railway line used in emergency, and in Nishihu Nabashi in Line 2 (Nakano Home).It is possible to fold with folded.There are two tickets, but there are central bidding and museum bidding, but the elevator connecting each home is only a central bid.Multifunctional toilets are the same. \\ N \\ n2013 (2013), as part of the Tokyo Metro Togi Line “Solar Power Plant” plan, a solar power generation system was introduced in Dang Station.In 2021 (3 years) December 5 (Sun), home doors were installed and started.As a station, it is the second largest after Toyomachi Station, which is a rapid stop station, and is the most common in the rapid passage between Toyomachi and Nashi Nabashi Station.Just below the station, we are orthogonal because there is a turtle head to the breast.It is close to Kasai -gu Public Kwando Station.Among them, there are buses with JR Koi Wa Station (stop by each station) and Gamero Station (Joban Line Station) of Hwanchil Shuttle, and buses from Shinskoi Station, Kincho Station, and Skytree Town.There is a business hotel near the station.I think I'm preparing to put a home door.\\ n is a subway, but it is a wonderful station with a passing line in the ground section.Hiroki on the railway system was also introduced a little.When it's extremely hot or cold, let's take a time coming.\\ n Subway ParkIt is famous that the water pipe is under high price.…Besides, only the ticket gate from the first car…/Hwan seven distances. \\ N It is the station of Tokyo Metro Zay Line and does not stop. \\ N There is also a bus to Disney Resort.There is the largest rock climbing gymnasium in Korea.You can enjoy more than 220 yen (220 yen).It's not as dangerous as Nishika because it's a track.There is also a convenience store as soon as the ticket gate comes out.There is a risk of high speed congestion, but in the airport better than the train.It was very helpful.Please use.Recommended (^^)/It's a little dirty!But Japan's MRT is very convenient!You can take a bus to Disney here!There are no restaurants in the station, but there are various stores such as banks, convenience stores, and fast foods.The first role in Kasai by chance…The lonely lively station was rarely felt.Can you commute to this station every day?If you say, it's hard!(Laughter) \\ N because you can only use the pottery line in this station, it's too much.Details/Tokyo Metro Toy Zay is the cassai station.In front of the station, there are several shops and restaurants.There is also a bus in front of the station in front of the station.There is a subway museum in front of the station.This station is a commuter speed and a regular stationary stop, but I think it is convenient. \\ N I always use it.People sneak down from this station.It is used to go to the gym in detail.There are Matsumoto Kiyoshi and Kentucky in front of the station. \\ N It seems that a lot of Kansai lives.Wow, Sunny Mall, or Don Kihoote is convenient for the next west Kasai.Is it more than Nishika?Speeding passes, and commuting speeds stop.Tokyo Island is also in Fantasy Line 7.It is a high -cost station, and there is a mall \"Metro Center\" or \"Subway Museum\" below the expensive price around the surrounding price.In front of the station, there is a Doebus platform. \\ N is the number of elevators in Nishihunabashi on the ground section of the Ceramic Line.It is inevitable that the groove is narrow because of the passing line, because it is inevitable that the speed passes.Wings of wind power are cool. \\ N bus is quite convenient.Indeed, since it was originally a rural area, the station was made with a lot of space, so there were quite a lot of withdrawal, the sidewalks and relief. \\ NIt feels like here !!Anyway, the famous program is full!Near my apartment, the drama called Rental Savior was made!It is a good station because there are not a lot of the stations (but it's very low (but it's good because there is an alternative, but it's good because there is a ticket nearby)./The subway museum gets
