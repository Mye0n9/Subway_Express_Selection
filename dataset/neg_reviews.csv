"
1," convenience is moderately good.I don't know if it's coming, but it's easy to use and a good part.If you use the EX Hotel Senda Kesa, the exit is convenient./ The station is a strange uncle.I think it's the first time, but at least the station of the station of Tokyo Metro Nagata Machi can say that.In the same station, you can go to Magome, Gotanda, and Asakusa, so it's very convenient, but it was only uncomfortable because there was no escalator going home from the ticket gate.There are many fucks because the branch station of the Keiku Line, this is the starting point of the Keikyu, and the barrier prefation is delayed.There is a gateway station.I was worried that I couldn't see the main cavity nearby.In the basement of the Daiichi Keihin National Route, the home width was narrowed, and the home door was quickly installed.There are two tickets at the north and southern ends of the station.The toilets are all outside the ticket gate, and on the north side, there is a toilet (a private room for the kidneyers and men and women).Doei Asakusa Line and Keikyu Main Station. "
2,"The transfer with NJR can be done in other stations, so it is not recommended to take a tour of Takanawa Station.side.The name of the station seems to resemble the temple, but I think JR's name is to withdraw if possible."
3," It is a very fast convenience in a short time stop.When the diamonds are so bad that the driving intervals in Nishimagome are empty, there is a lot of people with a narrow home.It is a Doyoung subway used in taxes, but it is a dangerous state for the situation.In order to take a taxi, it is necessary to go to the street, so I don't think it is a station that endures practical at this time.Some trains of the Margotes are also on the side of the Izumi Dake Sinagawa Station.Wheelchair is at the entrance of Mita Station.The groove is only staircase in the pattern.Maintenance with the Yamanote Line New Station!/Because there is only one side of the elevator and the escalator, the worst is for those who have a substitute from Haneda Airport or those who are uncomfortable. "
4," are old.I know that I like the analog of Japanese analog, but for people who are uncomfortable and foreigners from Haneda Airport, the batch of transit or the equipment is the worst./GOOGLE map, but the A1 exit is marked in the southeast, but it is closed because it is under construction.There is no sign during the closing of the exit, so if you find the entrance from the ground and the southeast, you cannot arrive at the station., I walk a little bit, but I survive. "
5," station is quite old and poor.There are many ointments of Akayoshisa Temple, and it is also a deep temple for Akayoshi.When Akaho was born and raised, I thought that when I was three, I thought I would endure once so that I would forget time in the television drama or movie of the loyalty.Doctors were quietly sleeping and felt that they were still in Japan.So far, Kabukina, doll premature ejaculation, television drama,…Please be careful when you visit Tokyo and go to Haneda Airport.In particular, if you take a train marked with ""Nishima Gome"", we will move in the other direction from Haneda Airport.I only passed through the details/a few o'clock, but I started the exterior with a transfer with JR. "
6," I took a picture of a signal at the intersection.If you are steep and uncomfortable, there are not only the temples of the Oishi Dakji area, but also the Tokyo star of the school and Goyasan.In addition, you can also go to one of the symptoms of the grass or the Sensoji of Asakusa. If you want to collect 御.Note that it is not available. "
7," ↔ Usually Nishima Me Yuki, Izumi Dake? (Laughter)./The branch station of Doei Asakusa and Keikyu Line.However, Keikyu's reverse number (KKXX) is not shaken.It is near Senga Kuji.I think there is a calm atmosphere./ If you try to go over the track of the JR, you have to hide a short and long tunnel.I answer quite a bit.Even if you look forward to redevelopment, it's quite the first to be redeveloped.Details/It's in vain even if you say this, but there is no toilet in the ticket gate?I do not know.So it seemed to leak in the train.It was very good to go to Sinagawa, but it was very fast in the hotel.Still during development.lost ??…/There is no problem because the ceiling is low and the old station transfer.There is a plate with the name of Akaho Langsa on the wall of the ticket gate.Be careful not to make a mistake.If you stand out, it will fall.

8,". The station of the JR Tamachi Station in Mita Station is not foolish, and I did not miss the ride.good!!When I go to Haneda Airport from the city center, I transfer to the Asakusa Line on the Mita Line on the Doei subway and use Mita several times.The number of passengers was also high, and the impression was always crowded.It is convenient to move from Mita Station to JR Tamachi Station without crossing the intersection on the ground, but it becomes a significant exercise because the distance is long.The ground is good in the JR Tamachi station, but because there is no contact ticket, it is necessary to go to the ground once. \Is there a staircase or a bad structure when you have a lot of baggage.. "
9," I am using the Asakusa Line, but Daiichi Kei's Tamachi Station exit has a lot of ""down the stairs"" to the gate, which is frustrated when you are tired.In addition, "
10,". Mita line is divided into upper and lower ends, so when you go to Otemachi, you have to lower the two -layer staircase, and you are also frustrated."

12,"JR Tamachi Station and Keio University.It is a 5 -minute walk from JR Tamachi Station, which is connected to the basement.I only have to go up and down a small staircase several times, and I think it's convenient to go on the ground.It tastes more than the Roppong Line of Doei Oedo Line, but does not want to go to Doei Mita.It is directly connected to JR Tamachi Station.The Doei Asakusa Line is located under the Hibiya Street, and is in contact with the underground passage.It is located in Minato -gu Shiba 5 Chomet in Tokyo.In other words, it is also far from the Asakusa Line and Mita Line, which requires several stairs and up and downs.Aside from this, Keo -Ki University, which is closest to this station, can go to Hiyoshi Campus by using the Mita Line, and is supposed to be connected to SFC by the Sotetsu Line, which is scheduled to open in 2022.For this reason, the Mita Line = Meguro Line = The three -line direct communication of the Sotetsu Line is called ""Keio Line"" .../Tamachi is too far from Mita.It is necessary, especially the downhill, even if there is almost no escalator.If your legs are uncomfortable, it is difficult to use in Carrie Cart.I would like to know what the wheelchair is, I want to know if there is information.Hanedawa will increase the transfer to the station in the reverse direction.The transfer is also simple. "
13,"This is a general train station. Keio's Asakusa Line and Oedo Line stops and are close to Tokyo Tower.Caution !!It is Daimon (Hamamatsucho), but there is an assortment of Hamamatsucho.It seems that many people transfer to Hamamatsu -cho in the Inada Monorail.It has changed. "
14,"I found a bakery on Google, but I was disappointed. "
15,b2 outlets are not recommended if possible. 
16," because we are stopping the escalator to resolve congestion, the heat that climbs the stairs is rather confronted, so it is very dangerous.When my eyes stopped suddenly, it seemed to fall out of balance and fell dangerously.Anyway, I endured it, but if you are trying to get rid of people behind you…"
17," second, there is an Oedo line, which is very good because you can go anywhere in Tokyo with this line.Doyoung's subway is convenient for transfers.There are also many restaurants that are very convenient./It's hard to find the toilet, so I told you to do it somehow because the violence is shaken, but I do nothing.Near Hamamatsukho/Succession with Tokyo Monorail is very bad.Especially in the early morning flights, the World Trade Center Building is not open./It is a bit confusing at first.

25, I hate Sinbashi because of you^_^
26,"2019 -I had a very bad experience at Sinbashi Station as the entire train network in Tokyo was stagnant.I was trapped inside the train and was trapped for almost an hour and a half after passing through Sinbashi.The railroad authorities failed to manage passenger traffic.The train was too crowded and the platform was crowded, so passengers could not get off the train.That day no one could step on the railroad platform.In the end, the authorities had to take a ticket to manage the entry traffic and open the exit gate./ The station connected to various lines with subway or Yurika Mome JR.When you come out of the station, the celery man's pub is unfolded.It is convenient for Yurika Momero to be convenient.there is.It is the role of the mind.The west exit of the station is SL, and the headquarters building in the east is lively.It is a station with detailed/JR, subway, Yurika Mome and various routes.It is often reflected in TV interviews.It was easier to pass by the ticket gate because it was better than before.In the opposite, there is a Shiodomeguchi of the Yurika Mome and the transfer.It is a pilgrimage spot where the main character is drawn./ Akihabara moved from Sinbashi./ If there is only a coffee shop counter and a small table seat, for one person.It's more than 500 yen of coffee unit price.This is a two and a half -month -and -a -month declaration of emergency.There are many withdrawals..The general opinion of Japan is Sinbashi Station./ It is a village with many foreigners./ Tokaido Main, Yamanote Line, Keihin Dohoku Line and Ginja Line, and Doei Subway Station.It's always a lively./When I go to the exhibition on the Tokyo Big Site, I go to Yurika Momo with a transfer transfer.Finding the locker is difficult to pick up because of the small lockers and wide, so it is difficult to pick up (> _ <) \It's so good and beautiful.Doei Subway Asakusa Line and Yurika Mega."

37," near Sinbashi Hagi and Dongguk.In the old days, it was close to Tokyo Station, which seems to have been a tent of the OTC, and it is a few minutes from Ginza Station.Obviously there is an elevator going to the platform 2 to go to Narita Airport.Eventually, I climbed the stairs with a heavy travel bag and arrived on the platform, but eventually missed the train, I had to wait 30 minutes to take the next train, and it took more time to go to the airport.It was scheduled to arrive at Narita Airport at 10:30 am, but it was delayed to 11:30 am because it missed the train for 2 minutes.

40," How to upload MAPS more?Is it difficult?The A1 exit has a constituency connected to the ground and is directly connected to the NARITA airport line via Osiage Station (Skytree).However, there is an escalator connected to the Haneda airport line only at the A5 exit.The fastest way to switch these two lines is to use the 1.5 -layer staircase.The A1 and A5 are just a few minutes' walk away on the ground path.There is no clear guidance near the connection staircase.I saw too many travelers to carry heavy burdens on the stairs.The station attendant will only tell you the stairs.I found a leaflet in Japanese in the A1 elections and experimented with how it works here.Fortunately, I was able to read a little bit of Japanese, but I had to go up and down with a heavy burden.Sinbashi Hagi is convenient at exit 6.You can transfer with the Doei Asakusa Line.A city that happens late at night.It's colorful and clean.When you come from the airport, it is convenient to use the elevator from the A1 access road./ If you go to the ticket gate, there is no passage.Two!

In the intersection, it is a modest distance.)It can be a lot of you can use the station as a sightseeing, so when you asked a question, there was a stationary attitude of the station and a station who did not use the word.The other station was a good person, but I'm sorry.He was a young man with glasses around 20 o'clock of 3/17.There is a limousine bus terminal from Naritana Haneda Airport (about 5 minutes on foot).?Please let go of the smartphone here?I felt very unpleasant.It may have been bad, but I want to quit if I can't take a polite response to the guests./""Tokyo Metro Hibiya Line and Doei Asakusa Line are also close to Hanzo Monsey Ten Kumade Station. "
61," because they are also available., I felt a bit uncomfortable with the Narita of the Asakusa Line, the Nishima Game Me, and the entrance."
62," If you go wrong at the destination exit, you can see the map when you get off at the station.In addition, it is possible to transfer to the Tokyo Metro Hanzomon Line Steenumade Station. "
63,"I couldn't go to Taiwan of the destination. I was in despair.Thank you so much for the phone.It is a 'livestock corridor' where salarymen who have lost their livestock to the slaughterhouse are lined up.The route is the Keikyu Main Line, the Keikyu Airport Line, the Doei Asakusa Line (Nishima Me Room) Keisei Osia Crab, Keisei Main, Kei Sei Narita Sky Access Line, and other lines.It is suitable for the sound of the VVVF sound and video shooting.Masen Yokoyama Station in the adjacent Doei Shinjuku Line is a transfer station in the Asakusa Line, and is a major station in Doei Subway, which is also designated as a transfer station. "
64,"JR is also connected to the Makuramachi station of the fast line, but there are quite a few distances via Makuyokoyama Station.It gives a pretty stylish feeling./ When we went to Tokyo Skytree on July 29, we bought a ticket at this station and lost the phone here, and when I returned to this station from Tokyo Skytree, I asked if I found a cell phone.It is.I accidentally found our cell phone in the lost corner of this site, and thank you very much. "
65,"2.Narita Airport direction: A4 exit/employee's response is excellent but stationIt feels an old feeling./ Because it has a torque, it is convenient because it collapses while waiting for the fast.It's a station./Fat staff wearing glasses has a lot of racism./ It takes time to transfer./ It's a quiet role./?/It's too far to go to the opposite home."
66," is a convenient place for travelers because there are many business hotels around the station.Where the mayor is located, the legs of the Ethora, crossing the Gandawa, which runs south, are originally originated from the Asakusa Bridge, but are far from Asakusa.I thought there was no entrance to the east, including the transfer of, but it turned out that there was also a western exit today.!/It is a station that connects Sobu and Asakusa Lines. "
67," I used this station at Dorikoshi Festival.People often confuse infant cars or large luggage that cannot be found on the Internet if they have an elevator in the station./ Because of the old station, the structure of the stairs or the structure of the stairs is bad, and because the escalator cannot be installed, the elderly want to be Gyeongwon because they cannot install escalators..If you go down the gate of JR and go downstairs, it consists of a staircase that goes down to the station of the Dowe Asakusa Line.Asakusa, which has tourist attractions such as Kaminarimon, Nacamise, and Sensoji, is the closest of the second Asakusa Station in Dogi Asakusa Line Ochasia, and is famous for its traditional ""Kuzuki.""It is a delay in the installation of the elevator or escalator due to the old making of the national season.In addition, there are always many elevated passengers, so there is also difficulty in installation work.Unless it is a 2F building, it may be difficult to improve!/Kaminarimon is Asakusa Station.You can walk along the Sumida River to feel good. "
68," Asakusabashi Station has a facility near Osiage, and the first day of Keikyu, the early morning all morning, was completed until many years ago.But clean and dirty time…The most severe thing was home garbage (a variety of big bags ... The courage of washing detergent…) is in the private room toilet ,,,.Then, the former person's dirt has not flowed, or vomiting, no toilet paper, (women's toilet).Saying not (it was stolen by someone ...) was very shocked...(Crying)/JR Sobu Line (Each Station) and the station of the Asakusa Line of the Doe Subway.The station of "
69,"jr was attacked by a radical attack in the `` simultaneous guerrilla case '' on November 29, 60 (1985).It is incapable of operating. "
70," The Boguji store at the exit is, there is no or no or amazing.The transfer is out of the way.Location "
71,"1985 (Showa 60)The damage and fire of the history of the national railway.It can also be expedited to Miura.The surrounding area is developing and it is a pleasant street.Since a user who cannot read the arrow from the passage from the car to the stairs is collapsing the line, it is necessary to complete the discrimination. "
72,It is the largest blot of the century this century.It is not good to have a significant lungs because of the broken lines.
73," is a pity that Midori's window has disappeared./ Asakusa is the station next to two, and the Asakusa bridge.When you leave the station, the doll's doll shop is side -by -side, but the ninjocho is next to two.This is the Asakusa Bridge.Of course, the minimum tool is equipped, but the leather has a bad quality or color as a whole, and I have been caught in some shops as if the fake and recycled leather of Kodoban is thick.Asakusa's leather shop is completely good.The elevator that can be used is also a structure that suffers quite a bit of a weak foot because of the limited location.It is a city that loses morality. "
74,"The line is connected, and the in front of the station is a wholesale mall, especially wholesalers related to accessories are concentrated.There are also a few restaurants in front of the station, and it is also on office distance.It is better to change it.If you have an elevator, the elderly will be comfortable.There are many shops under the guard.The winter night landscape felt somewhere old longing./ The station facility on the home of the JR line is removed or reduced, but the groove is a little narrow.It is inevitable because it is quite old, but the transit side of the Dowe Asaku Line is a crowded sign because the ceiling is low and the passage passing under the track is narrow. "
75," We ask for the amendment of the law by Gukju.If you walk up, the steel is designed with a clean curve.There are many.The transit passengers do not appear in the village, so the restaurant is difficult, but the sentence level is high.However, there is a high difference between Asakusa and Sobu Line, and it is necessary to move in the horizontal direction, so convenience cannot be appreciated.I don't think that I want to go to food and shopping on the Asakusa bridge, and I don't think that I want to go to food and shopping.Akihabara cannot arrive unless he changes the elevator of the home and the ticket layer.The toilet for the disabled may be intentionally contaminated and cannot be used.The toilet water in the women's toilet does not come out.Although it is expensive, the distance is strange in any route, so there is always a tendency to be late immediately after the kick.The recent elevator is also bothersome than walking, rather than a mystery structure from the second floor.The station is not very motivated.There are two extremely inconveniences/exits that have been made when they are high -priced decades ago, but if this is the first time, it is difficult for the elderly to have only a large staircase because the elevator or escalator is on the subway.The wheelchair has an elevator at the opposite entrance, but the road under the station is narrow, so the JR is not for the guest, but from the administration.Despite the many things, the east exit is the station of the JR Sobu Line, which is not installed even an elevator or escalator. "
76," overseas travelers have a big trunk, and they are well seen that are being up and down.It has become an intestinal intestines that are incomparable with the previous.There is no elevator, Chiba, and Akihabara's uncomfortable side of the legs that must be hidden in the stairs.Say, Osaka Fantasy LineThere is a similar atmosphere (^o^) "
77," I think it is a convenient and lively station../ It is also used as a transfer with ASun.In Rush, it's hard to have a narrow open place that doesn't go well.There seems to be a lot of taverns around Akihabara.It seems that tourists who want to go to Asakusa are sometimes wrong, but it takes about 20 minutes to walk to Asakusa.If you come wrong, take the Asakusa Line as it is.The home of the Asakusa Line is only the east exit, and the downtown is also the eastern entrance.It takes a few minutes from the west exit to the east exit. "
78," The west exit is quite dark in the middle of the night, but you have lived for 5 years and has never felt bad.Yes, it is possible but very inconvenient. "
79," and the more uncomfortable west exit.Near this station, there are many puppet stores such as Guwol.The origin of the name Asakusabashi is because the as the Sensoji, which leads to the Sensoji, was near this station."
80," I was able to do an elevator at the western exit, but it is a little hard because it is a two -stage because it cannot be directly in the structure.There is no escalator. "
81," is dragged around the station, and there are deep foodists and hotels around the station. "
82," The surrounding area is a down -down residential area of Shimo Machi.The Oedo Line is very far from exit to opening.And since there are no posts to announce diamonds in the ticket gate, I don't know if I will leave in the next a few minutes, so I have a yakimoki in the morning.Will go out once.Please enter the orange ticket gate.The subway in the province is generally convenient./ At the station of the Doei subway, the Asakusa Line Kuramade Station was opened, and later Oe Doseon Kuramade Station was opened.It is marked with a transit in the same diagonal lines, but the station of the lines is about 300 meters from the road and is not connected to the underground road.The transit passengers can leave the ticket gate and pass through the entrance of the transit line and the ticket gate via the ground exit and the general road report (open -air).It is called, and there is also a guide in the air broadcast, ""Oe -do (Asakusa Line) is a ground transfer."" "
83," ※ I'll add it later../ If you have a lot of luggage !!!!Be careful when using this station. There is no elevator inside the station.If you make a mistake, your life will change.It is the end that the cost is low, but it is not possible to carry the goods.. "
84," climb the stairs on the ground and cross the crosswalk.Or down the stairs of the station home and go up this time.If your knees are bad, you will die.?. "
85, I think the vicinity of the station is calm and good.It is an image of a hidden spot or a hideout shop.Some outlets are under construction.It seems that there will be a hotel in the future./It is difficult because you have to go to the ground once you transfer. 
86," If construction is difficult, you have to guide you. "
87," If you try to use an elevator, you will walk quite a bit.It is not a level that can be said, but it is called a transit station.Of course, it depends on the destination, but the transfer to the Oedo and Asakusa Line is not here, but the “gate”.Transfer in Daimon can be easily done.In addition, there are few guidance on the ground.This world is not the same as the organized mall, but there are quite a few restaurants.There are Epoksa and Bandai from the toy wholesalers.Somehow, the hospitel of the backpacker is also cheaper in the connection station of the Oedo Line and the Asakusa Line, but if the person who is wandering in the transfer continues, how many times the person has heard the entrance, the signboard needs to be even more needed.The Asakusa Line is a relative, so if you go through the entrance wrong, you will not be able to go to the groove unless you go through the liaison passage under the groove or go back to the ground and cross the road.There is a distance of less than 300m from Oe Doseon Guramade Station, so it is inconvenient because it is a transfer.I'm so tired to walk.Kuramade. "
88," I bought a 3 -day subway pass, and I finally understanded a little after the day's transfer experience.You should be able to see it, and if you don't know, ask the passengers or station attendants on the same train! ""It is not very convenient to move from one to the other on the Asaku Line.So is the equipment old?There are many bad stories (four).The image of Doyoung has changed./The design of the interchae is very poor and there is a lack of accurate explanation of the subway map.The Oedo Line Station was completely connected to the Asakusa Line Station.I had to take my luggage upstairs and walk for 10 minutes to Asakusa Line.There is no escalator at the entrance.Many tourists arrive at the airport using this connection and suffer from this nightmare.It seems to have been deliberately done with the harassment of N Doe Subway users.Before we transfer properly, I want you to express it in Japanese, English, Chinese, and Korean.For the elderly and those with bad legs, it was hard to know and complained for foreigners.In the normal Japanese people, the hard and tired body came to the head!I bypassed a stop away to go to the elevator on the plane, but I couldn't find it.Finally I carried my luggage down.I went up the stairs and saw the elevator exit!The entrance to the elevator and the outlet are so weird!/The round -trip transportation with Haneda Airport is not provided.However, there is an elevator for carrying the baggage at the A0 exit.It is connected to the route to Narita Airport.If you are going to Haneda Airport, you need to pull your luggage and climb the stairs to the opposite platform.Plan ahead of which entrance to use before you bring your luggage.And from 33 years in Showa, three Tokyo places have been held in the year.The history that remains in my impressions is Ohho, Kashiwato, Tochinokai, Sada's mountains, North Fuji, Koto Sakura, Wajima, and the sea of Mie.In addition, the name of the role of Kurama is derived from the Mikura of the shogunate in this land.In short, it has been only 30 years since the summo was performed in the current two -country national makes.The transfer of the Oedo and Asakusa Line is about 5 to 10 minutes by walking on the ticket gate and the ground.If you go to a crowd fireworks every time, there are road regulations or various regulations if you do not go from the morning.??…/The entrance of the Oedo Line and the Asakusa Line of the Guramade Station are different.I think it would be nice to have an elevator.The transfer of the Oedo and Asakusa Line is not recommended because it walks a significant distance.The succession of Oedo and Asakusa is too bad.I didn't know it at first. "
89,"← I don't know?There cannot be.The guy who designed such a transfer station is quite far from the Doei and Asaku Lines.Let's confirm in advance./It's only in Tokyo Marathon.It's easy to use.I can't help it, but every time I visit, I get tired of the inconvenience of transfer.It is an absolute nightmare.There is a separate entrance in each direction.!/To go to Asakusa, this is empty.It takes/rarely used station/ground transfer is too much.Far away ./ It is easy to know ./ I use it many times.It's hard to find/It's a long way to get a transfer ./ I can't see anything.Station/Yeah/Old subway station/production is bad."
90," You can be mistaken for the Asakusa subway station.There are also Don Quixtes or GUs nearby.Cool authentic ornament.Please feel good about your destination.The station is a bit difficult to explore, but much less difficult than Shinjuku ??/The main station of the Tsukuba Express Asakusa.Nearby, "
91," Asakusa over there will be difficult because it walks a little on foot.Not Sakusa.As you can see from the map, the distance is quite far.So there are no lines or subways in the transit guide.I was so confused that I wanted to change the name of the station .../I was worried that I would have a review because there was a caminarimon's Chocho on the day of the typhoon.I'm very shocked in red, and I think I took a picture with my boyfriend before.I have memories.The surrounding eel shops and restaurants have not changed at all, so it seemed to have a time slip.It was so cold that I didn't explain it, I only pointed to the ticket gate, and I made only the cross. I'm sorry. It took a long time to find out how to enter the station. In Japan, which boasts a service, imagine that I meet this unkind station.Express, only people who use it. "
92, transfer is not recommended.Is it better to change your name?It is the closest station of Asakusa Loku. 
93," also has a bus stop with the name of the station, but the platform is divided by the destination, there is a distance from each other, so there is no guide from another platform in the bus stop itself (or it is hard to knowBecause it might be a work), it's used to changing the bus. "
94," If you don't rush, you want to change from Oshigami, but there is a place where the bus stop is distributed over this station.When you get on the ground, the sky tree looks big, so it's unintentionally called ""Oh!"".I used it to go to the point.The Senga Kuji is the A5 exit.On the map, the elevator is facing the third distance next to the left side of the left side.Lawson Nari, who is facing Azumabashi 3 Chome Asakusa Street, is an elevator to the Osiagalo home.It is running to Sinbashi via Sinbashi.Giba ~ Toyos is a cross -marriage section.This is close ./ ????Check in on the way…/As soon as you leave the station, you will see Sky Tree nearby. "
95," There is a staircase that connects the front of the downhill home and the uphill home, but it is almost meaningless for reverse.I want to connect this staircase to the ticket gate!? "
96," If you walk from the Hanzo Mon Line to the province, it will suddenly darken, so in the future, you will be really home anxiety. "
97," The current accident isI think it's a little, but I hope you will improve the home door or lighting quickly.From there, you can go to the Sky Ticket store directly from there.When I put it in a coin locker, I used suica.I think it is convenient because it can be used both cash and transportation electronic money.The fare is 400 yen and 500 yen, and the bag is enough to enter the 500 yen.However, it is difficult to get rid of the Locker Certificate or the first card used, so you have to do it for sure.In addition, the end of Doei Asakusa and Keisei Osia Crab.Hanzo Mon Line has a lot of fuck trains, so if you choose to sit down, you can sit down.Tobu Zoo Park) can be transferred.This is a big station where you can use both subway.This station is very close to Tokyo Skytree, Soramachi (Sky Town) and Sumida Aquarium.It is clean and smells good.The direction is clear.Nearby is a supermarket that can use a D point card.The supermarket that can use the D point card is opened in the lower part of the business hotel next to it.You can go to Haneda and Narita by Doei Subway.It was a lack of awareness.I knew that Tokyo Skytree Station and Osiage (in front of Skytree) were different stations.To go to Asakusa Station in Dobu, you have to change it to worship ./ I walked from Asakusa. "
98, people who are using water come out without seeing it?/The response of the station is too bad. 
99, There is one elevator.My shoulders hurt !!It was a place to drop the smartphone of San Fool.\ u3000/The cherry blossoms bloom along the river (Kitaju Magang) just below the skyy.Moderately benches are also deployed.. 
100,"?I don't want to go again.If you don't know the station and listen to the place?I received the same attitude, and when I heard from another station, I was aiming at the top.I will never go again.The toilet was immediately after entering, but a long -time sensor was triggered and I was very embarrassed.It is the closest station of the Tokyo Sky Tree, which is very clean and managed.I heard it for the first time, and when I heard it a few times, I finally answered.However, the transfer method was different and eventually not attached to the destination.Because the attitude is bad and lies, I don't want to use this station anymore.It is a connecting station of the Asakusa Line. "
101," has a long stop time because there is a tension by connecting.I don't need time.There is a poster that suppresses violence, and I think it's strange that the violence of passengers from the guards is strange.// The subway and the central exit of the Asakusa Line are clean with Skytown.The following routes will run.This is the last stop of the three routes. "
102," Tokyo Metro Hanzomon Line (Station Number Z -14)One is for Keise/Doi on the B1 floor, and the other is Tokyo Metro/Dobu on the B3 floor.Each consists of two island platforms that offer four tracks.The exit on the side of Magome is somewhat far away to go to Skytree, but shakes enough to fall.But the store was really fun.It is also convenient because it is directly in the sky tree.I am also crowded because I am also in contact with Keisei./I think the grooves are dangerous because the stairs in the Oceans of the Osiagen line are too narrow. "
103," If you do not install a home door, I think an accident occurs someday.♪/I can use the Hanzo Mon Line and Doei Asakusa Line.Since there is an elevator, I think it is good for those who are difficult to use the stairs.Which direction is the Asakusa Airport Line?Who designed this?It doesn't help at all./Depending on the outlet, the towering sky tree is powerful./This location is a very good view on the www "
104," or difficult to understand/the station attendant was terrible \Therefore, if you are a person who is aimed at "
105,"I don't use much, but the escalator, which was not before, was installed, making it a clean station.The place where the ticket gate was left was the same as the space relationship.It was a pity that the west exit also had a rusty feeling compared to the time when the station was formed.// Fujimi's Choi -dong station.Since there are San Marc in Naka, the convenience seems to be good.There is a lack of personality as a downtown. "
106," The east exit is just above the apartment.Now we go back to the normal start melody!!!/Is it a car society that I don't want to go to work, walking or bicycle life means death and death.It was a station that I used as a work many times before, but I couldn't think of where I was listening to the name of this station recently.It is difficult to guess.Minori Dai Toki Wada Dai Kashi and Dai Midori Dai Suzukake University do not think of where they are.Sorry/It's quite old, but "

112," home door, waiting room.There is also a fuck and end of the trains, and the express station is also convenient. "
113, Rotary is new.There are also a lot of buses and a limousine bus stop to the airport.Do you know that you are a service industry?? 
114," What is this year?Tentively, the poster was posted on the one -day limited release of Asaka Station and Fujimino Station, but most of the stations were 10 days (Mon).The first buyer was.I think most people use it from the 10th.By the way, it is the planning department of Dobu?Did you think about it? "
115," because you are doing this, the reputation of Tow Chosun (Dobu) does not improve, so you can't win W Seibu.You can also put gender and bitterness soon?Why is it a rural person./It was faithful with shopping or food.. "
116," is close to the city of believers and Shishi, and the station is located.Each station stop "
117," It is easy to use in that all genres are equipped../ Do not ride the treasure again.They stopped almost 50 km of train in an accident for an hour on weekends.I hope that the Tobu Line will go bankrupt.Anyway, there's nothing on this train line.Please stay in Tokyo, but stay in Inaka./ The train is complicated and difficult. "
118,"It is a connection between JR and Dobu Dojo, but Imai Tennant is not difficult.This does not mean that the station does not have a convenient rescue, and there is an inconvenience that cannot be on the street due to the waves of those flowing to Asakadai ~ North Joseo Kasumi.It is good to divide the exit according to the thorough direction..The structure of the. "
119," Asakashi has a lot of waiting children and a lot of children.In some cases, there are times when it is not suitable between trains.Now I want to ask for the installation of ""home doors"" in the morning band.Only Asakadai Station remains due to the bronze line.Meanwhile, the apartment is a construction rush.For some reason, North Asaka Station and Asakadai Station are risk of abnormally narrow home.There are a lot of users, but it is strange ./ This station is used to go out.It is convenient to go to Yokohama with the Yura Kuku Line, and the bankruptcy line.The bus also goes to Hibari Gaoka Station to use the transportation well, there are many schools and students stand out.It is a station that can be transferred to a Musashino line, so the morning rush is difficult.…In detail/""This is a role that I use frequently. I am especially convenient or uncomfortable for me. Sometimes I look at the changes of the times, and it was not a temporary work, especially the place I was interested in. "
120,"/There are no elevators or slopes, so strollers and wheelchair users are hard to use."
121," and there is no inconvenience to transfer.Although it is different, it is adjacent to North Korea's Kasumi Station, so it is possible to transfer with the JR Musashino line.One of the main stations of the Dobu Dogsonjo is stopped by TJ Liner, a paid seat designated train.The facilities around the station are also faithful to the convenience.Although it was a jurgey railroad of the diesel, the route to Dobu was via Asakadai.I think the transfer on the Musashino line is okay with 4 minutes.There was a rarely picture of the overpass on the station.It is a station of the JRS that is adjacent to JR North Korea Kasumi Station. "
122, The next year of opening the Bukjo Kasumi station in the Musashi Line was installed.There is no elevator.I was surprised that there was this station now. 
123," I told the stationary stroller, ""Is this station no elevator?""I was stupid and hurried, and I was afraid of each child at a distance and dropped the stairs.I felt bad because of the station.I don't think it is used again.When Wolyeong has a small child, I think it's a transfer of transfer by yourself.Can't walk a little more and improve the transfer path?Especially JR.Anyway, it won't be brighter?It was to transfer and transfer. "
124," is called one star in cognition, and we'll be a star deduction.It is unkind production for those who have a stroller because there is no, and it is an unkind production.There is also a bus in Rotary.There are many restaurants in the chain store around the station, so it is very convenient.There are three stores around the station (Olympic, Dobu Store, Miraberu) around the station./ First of all, there is no elevator.There is no elevator when you go to the stairs as it is.Because of this, you can retain or forced dangerous movements to escalators.Nowadays, I think that this is a rare case that we do not respond to this, but it is rare.I really hate this role..I feel very uncomfortable.Asaka Station next to the station is faithful to the station of the station.It is connected to the Musashino Sun North Jose Kasumi Station.. "
125," Recently, it has become a convenient station for Asaka Station on the side.The North Asaka Station on the JR Musashino Line is transferred directly from the Dang Station.Train species other than the TJ liner and the speed of speed are stopped. "
126," ※ This is a stop station of Kawa -Gogo, which was newly established with the amendment of the March 2019 (2019) diary.Kawago's express is not stopped to the end of Ikebukuro Station.Wakoshi (Tokyo Metro) and Narimas Station are also passed.Please note that the user is the ground station of the island home.There is no elevator in the party.There is an escalator. "
127," ※ Some trains are on the Tokyo Metro Yuraku first and bankruptcy from Wakoshi Station.You can also see Tokyo Metro Vehicle and Tokyu Train Vehicle.Dodgeon is the third largest after Ike Bukuro Station and Wakoshi Station.In the entire road, Ike Bukuro Station, Wako -shi Station, and other Senju are the fourth scale.I think that home doors will be installed in the future.The transfer time is about 4 minutes in a hurry.The shops are focusing on the stations and the premises rather than Ekinaka.Previously, there was a regular ticket store, but abolished.Asaka Station was a station near the Olympic shooting range, so it was a nicely home door (although it was meaningless because it was a non -service guest).At least I want to install a home door or install it in terms of safety.It was an uncomfortable but soft station.There are no stairs and escalators, elevators nor slopes.The expresses are also stopped at the station of transit station/Dobu Dojo with Dodo Dojo, JR Musashi Line, and North Asaka Station.Therefore, even if it rains, it can be transferred without an umbrella.There are two bus rotarys, so there are limited places to cross the track, so be careful.It is station.I am using JR Musashi Line North Asaka Station, so I use it very well for transfer.Since it is a terminal station, it is very convenient because there are many mops and restaurants in front of the station.!

403," From this station, the Nishinaka Kajima Minamikata Station on the Osaka Metro Midosuji Line is right in front of you, and I think it is very convenient for transfer.It is installed in each of the upper and lower lines, and there is no passage between the upper and lower lines.It is also installed, so you can move to the opposite side when the crossing is closed.People are always safe!/This station is the lowest.New Year's Day is quiet, but the number of people calling that you are walking is abnormal and you can't even walk or pass.It becomes a rush.It is a subway station to Shin Osaka, but if you have time, you can walk to Shinosaka Station for about 10 minutes.There are many taverns and restaurants and many businessmen near the station.If you have been for the first time or a long time, please check which side is riding.However, if you talk to the station, you can use it as it is (table), but there is nothing special, but it is a transit station with the southern station of Kajima Kajima.Only the quasi stops.There is also a Nescafe stand in the home.

691,"This station is a station that can come as a Kawasaki quickly when you arrive at Haneda Airport.It is a station that is very embarrassed by the beginner and there is a Japanese school next to it.This is because the station is like a residential alley.Don't panic, follow any road in a busy direction, and if you get a range or a big famous building, you can find the starting point for the starting point.If you go to the busy side, you will get a DICE.Cognitive, relatively small feeling.In general, the station is not very clean, but it's because of Kawasaki, whether it's because of Keikyu.I don't know if it is.Since it is an arrival area of the ambassador to the Ambassador Kawasaki, New Year's Day will be a difficult withdrawal.JR Kawasaki Station is a 5 -minute walk.It is a taste of the taste of Sasan Station.The old red trains are also alive and are the missing atmosphere of the show somewhere.The main line is 4 lines of high -cost sages and 4 lines of the tidal station, two sides of the ground station.The finals stop the train, except for Morning Wing (Weekdays) and evening Wings.(The ambassador usually runs only trains.Opening. "
692, ambassador and this is a long -awaited atmosphere.This is! 
693, It stops except the wing! 
694, emergency connection often occurs! 
695," because the metabolic line is a start -up route on the Keikyu train, the ambassador's groove is shaking from the first.Never. "
696, The finals are the main stations of all train stops except for the morning and evening.The ambassadors only stop each station. 
697,All other trains stop. 
698, was very scary. 
699,I'm sorry. 
700, I don't want to break my legs between the house and the train.. 
701,"There is a place to be losing, and the congestion is pressed, "
702," It is always sold out, but I was able to buy it by chance../ Unusual two -story station.The finals are the second floor of the high price.The ambassador is buried from the head of the head.Direct driving on the finals and the ambassador is not the present.Kawasaki → Kawasaki → Keikyu Kawasaki Station was renamed.Among Kei Hin's express, he has the largest number of home 7 lines.It is exactly called an anti -flap -type guide indicator.There is "
703," It is one of the means of traffic to Haneda Airport in addition to the city center, Yokohama, and Yokosuka.I think it is big.It is riding not only people but also big and small luggage.In a normal vehicle, it is.It's a short time.It is missing during the day. "

"
707,"Kei Hin Express, Nanseong Branch Line, and Tokaido Cargo Ships are the station crossing.It's been a long time since I went to shoot a cargo train.The point is that when using the IC card, it will not be processed unless it is touched twice of the grooves of the abdomen line and the exit of the gay Hin Express line below.I failed myself and handled it at the manned window.It is a route that does not have a large number of times. "
708," Keikyu line usually stops outside, and the native line has a small number, but when the timing of diamonds is timing, the walking distance is significantly changed than the transfer in Kawasaki, so the rainy season or the midsummer day is transit.It is also recommended to consider the use./ Only the ordinary cars stop at Kawasaki and JR Nasal Line Station.It is also "
709,". In the case of both companies' transit, the noodles are also in the case of transportation, and in the case of transportation of the two companies, the transportation is passed through the bridges.As a stop, people who go to Yokosuka, Tokyo or Yokosuka, go to Keikyu Kawasaki next to them, and especially ride.In front of the station, there is a small mall and a crossword, and there is a cheap product because there is a lively lodging station (Hijincho).The recent fire of Toya has led to many dead people.Since then, the administration has a vertical discount administration, and the new accommodation is increasing, and the park (commonly known as a triangular park), which is followed by the Keikyu line, and the people who are full of work early and work, and the general public was difficult to go, but nowIs usually a park.The area around Kawasaki Station has been opened at the Toshiba ruins at the west exit of Kawasaki Station, and after the opening of “Rajona Kawasaki”, the west exit side has also increased, but the past stores, Cyama department stores, Numaya, etc.Bad images are displeased and I am visiting a lot from far away.. "
710," The movement of the up and down between the Keikyu Home is the form of passing the JR's groove instead of the Doosun Bridge.Since there are about 2-3 every time, it can be said that there are not many in the metropolitan area.It was a sense of discomfort to present 18 youth votes with N Geumyu's ticket gate, but of course it was a problem.

711, It was a very difficult station. 
712," is less unexpected!If you don't do it anyway, it seems to be delicate of suicide anyway./Jo-a station that should not be used when you don't have time. "
713," This is called Hachicho.Since the floor is a hot chocolate of JR Higashi Nanhua Line, it goes from the ticket gate of the gay queue and climbs the staircase to reach the home of the eggplant.The main line is usually stopped. "
714," The train to Yokohama is a composition that descends the slope.There is an old Tokaido with Keikyu./It's a local opinion, but it's convenient when you get to Tsurumi, Kawasaki Daishi, Haneda Airport.It is a station that is not tolerable to like cargo trains."
715," is also saying that there is a story of the high -ending of the Keikyu finals, so it may be the next decades to see this structure.It is a really subtle station that is called the complex station of the Jiji Line Station, but it is convenient in the sense that it can be the starting point for Sinagawa, Yokohama, and Musashi Kosugi as soon as you transfer.On the street, it is convenient when Keikyu is troubled, but on the contrary, it is painful that you can't ride at all when you receive a transfer of JR.Plus 100 yen Lawson and Origin Lunch Box are concentrated, but the convenience is cut and feels a waste.In addition, the measures are waiting because human accidents occur frequently before the crossing.The same is the same as the Keikyu main line (usually only a stop) and the native line (passenger and cargo passes by).It is a thrilling place to pass through the crossing of 120 km / h short after the other alarm sound rang.Daiichi Kein Kawa's crossing intersection is the location of the road, and bus guidelines are controlling the bus's movement. "
716," is a very annoying station when used as a passenger, and the branch line has a time zone where the train does not come at all.I think the evening exposed to a strong West is midsummer.And when you get on and off, you may have been mistaken for a lot of money if you don't stab an IC card on a dedicated terminal at home, and it's possible to get a lot of money (what will happen to the table…)Conversely, the scenery of the light and local sensitivity is very moody, so there are some things that come even more people who are not trains like me.I don't think there's any damage once in a lifetime.JR's passenger response is also carried out by Keikyu Station.

719," because I don't know where JR station is in or elsewhere, it was very difficult to ring around the station.When I entered Keikyu, a small guide was finally found…/Because the ticket gate is divided into the upper and lower lines between the crossing, it is inconvenient because it is rarely crossed in the rush.And even if you use your legs, there are many stairs and this is inconvenient.There are fewer southern lines.It has been a hotbed of thinking since ancient times, so there is a condition that must be cleared, but the administrative and railway company cooperates to improve somehow.There is nothing special in front of the station.If you come up from the Hin Express Home, the entrance to another local line.It's 209, but one man driving?wen…It was definitely EF-64.I remember it seemed to be 28mm.The track is running north -south, so if you take a freight train, the morning is in the morning.So 85 ~ 300mm is recommended.The same train accident occurred again.The spirit of the dead may be waiting for a person who is to be coming.At around 10:45 pm on February 1, 2, and 2, Kanagawa Sinmachi Machi -kamata Temple was died of a woman.Now 3rd.There was a led Tsuka nearby./ In the home of the Nananji Line, there is no announcement of the train access, so be careful with the announcement of ""I will be a train, the train passes through, etc.""Gyewon is only gay Hin Express.Keikyu running like a carbaten and 2 cars, and Koto's contrast is the tomb of JR.However, cargo trains also pass by.On the second floor, the JR Nanbu Line runs to Hamaka Wasaki and Sitge.

722,"JR I walk a little from Kawasaki Station./JR Tsrumi Station The commercial facility is very faithful at the east exit of Tsrumi Station and I feel that it is a really good station in the Keikyu line.But unfortunate…Then it was perfect.Only the express and ordinary stops at the station of 2 and Singles and 1 Line.There is a second floor on the second floor, and there is a bus rotary between the thrumi station of the JR line.About 20 minutes without transfer.Completed over 2 years.There is the first opening of ""Potapastacappestation"" and ""Shinpachi Restaurant""./Keikyu Thrumi Station is a naka station that is a little far from JR's thrumi station, where the airport express and the normal of each stop stops.The Express was stopped, not the [Airport] in the Sinagawa, but it was abolished due to the delightful faithfulness of the summer of 1999.Express management is revived by the species of [Airport Express] from the airport, evaporating every 10 minutes due to the high -priced Kamata in October after two years, and then, Kawasaki, Kamata, Haneda Airport, Sinagawa,The move to Yokohama has become close./ Because the express stops, you can go to the airport and Zhi!Number of elevators: 31500 people (2016)Super, pharmacy, and meals are relatively convenient.The expresses and rapids of the Keiku Line stop.In front of the station, there are several shops, including under the high line.The JR thrumi station can go in a few minutes on foot.Please look forward to 5 minutes ??If you are a Keikyu line, each stop and airport express will stop.Pleasant specials pass at a slower speed than 120 km/h.This is because there is a slope on the side of Hanazuki Enma.Keikyu of the Standard Arc (1435mm) is characterized by strong winds and difficult to luck.In the case of snowfall, it is advantageous because there is an electric snow machine.In the case of an earthquake, it is restored to slowdown by the intensity of shaking, which occurs faster than the JR line.The Kei Hin Tohoku Line will stop the emergency button at Sinbashi Station for ATC, for example, the Yamanote Line, Kei Hin Tohoku Line, and Tokaido Line suddenly stop.It may be restored to one minute, but it takes more than 30 minutes in a human accident (the time when the tuna processing of the term terms ends), so if there is no problem in driving like Keikyu, it passes through the field and passes through the field.Minimizing it is tremendous.I have checked the accident site in the car window many times.It took time when it was under the body.In the case of a power outage, the crossing breaker does not work, so it is impossible to drive.It is the owner that the Keiku Line did not recover on the East Japan Earthquake Day.Overall, it is a Keikyu that is resistant to transportation disorders, but it is a condition in which side it will use.This is the information exhibition!Previously, it was when it had stopped only the station stop, but now it is a stop station.It is convenient to go to Haneda Airport or Zhi./Artery is improved by the air level.It can also come out in the car area.

761," because of that, the access to the downward groove must use stairs or elevators.When I was young, there was no deck connected to Higashikanagawa Station and only stopped each stop. "

"
767," because Keikyu runs a lot of fast trains, it is passed by Bang Bang.The stops are the only stops of each station.There is no commercial facility.It is a small station.The station itself is dark and the groove is very narrow, so be away from the braille block! "
768," is a express, express passing station.I think it's not…/Because it is the same as the wise, the station representing Kanagawa Prefecture…There is no one, and it is a stiff station with elements as a non -Gyeong -jung in the city, such as the ghost home, the passage of the car, the train of the high speed, and the simple history.Anyway, it is chosen as a reverse white ship of Kanto./It is a Keikyu station next to Yokohama Station.

1174," Wouldn't you be deceived as a person who is not used to railroads?It is very convenient to stop expressing the expense.It was a place in front of the station.It is also a high point that it is also a high -ranking station.While Shibuya was fast and convenient, the commuter time zone was very crowded at rural teaching, and the atmosphere of the shop was also good at home.This is, because the station/track, which stops expresses, is passing through the valley floor, there is a very high and low difference between the platform.The express also stops.There are relatively many people, so it's a crowded impression.The express stop, but to get off on purpose…I wanted to go to Bigo's shop, but I'm sorry for a regular holiday.When you try to abolish "

1180,"Near Aza Mino Station, Talis Kentucky and others are.When the express stops, many people come down.The area is unfolded, but "
1181," There are not many restaurants in front of the station.After the opening, I started to flourish around the station, but when I walk a little, I still feel the countryside, and I like the place that hasn't developed too much.I don't think I'll do it.I was doing it at one time, but even if there is a man who is on board a woman -only car, he can't see the station.The deputy leader passes through the car, but if it has no relationship, it is completely through.Doesn't that mean?The groove of the documentary is a greenhouse structure that blocks the air conditioning+sunlight+wind, so the temperature is higher than the outdoor.I was returning home to Azamino.I didn't say anything particularly, but when the response was completed a little, I was screaming, 'Why are you a member of society.I don't have a bad thing, but why can I scream in front of my guests?It was used to go to Kawasaki Okamoto Taro Art Museum in Ikuta Greenery in Kawasaki City.You can take a bus to Kagaokayuen Station and walk from the bus stop.Opened in 1977, the underground station of the Yokohama City Subway Line 3 was also used at the Tokyu Denento Ship Line.In the old days, I was using it to go to the preliminary bridge near here.The transfer of the line ""Blue Line"" is possible. "
1182," It is also the last stop of the Yokohama City Subway Blue Line.However, there is also a part of the expressway of the cucumbers.The connection passage contains convenience stores and Saki Yogen tenants.Terminal Station. "
1183," is a station where the rural city is stopped, but it's small compared to Tama Plaza or Aobadai. "
1184," Azamino Station is very convenient because it can use rural tutorial and blue lines.It is late because it is not done right away because it is not done.It is often used at times.In front of the station, there is a little building, so I think it is enough.From here, about 25 minutes until Chuobayashi, about 12 minutes until Nagatuda, about 4 minutes to Sanuma, 11 minutes to Mizo's mouth, about 15 minutes to Futakotamagawa, and about 30 minutes to Shibuya, OcianIt is about 1 hour and 6 minutes until it is about 2 hours and 9 minutes until the Nandan Ribashi.(It may be rough, so there may be mistakes.)It is convenient because the Tokyu Store is next to the station in the express stop.Existing shops, resurrection shops, new shops and diverse.The Tokyu Denento gaze stops all the trains, including express and quasi.It is the most congested from 7:30 to 8:00 in the morning. "
1185," The station is in a shopping facility called Etomo, a side dish of the underground -style underground, and a paul or a cafe of the bakery.Then, Talize Coffee and Tokyu Store are also available.There is a buckwheat shop in the stationary inspection and a small loson on the home.The opening floor of the subway contains Ogawa Coffee, Family Mart and Saki Yogen.It is convenient for eating snacks or simple shopping.When I came out of the ticket gate, I had a lot of shops, so I thought I was happy because I could eat near the station, but I realized that I did the station wrong, embarrassed and burned the train.(Laughter)/Yokohama Municipal Subway Blue Line.I rode in Shonandai, but I was in bad condition, so I went to the bathroom while I was barely attached to Azamino.The time has passed, he was not able to pass the ticket gate in the watermelon and tried to explain and pass the situation at the window.Damn the worst.Unlike Tokyu, it feels so bad./In the past, the station that only stops at each station at the nearest station of Yama Uchi Library.As a rural areas, Azamino, Tama Plaza, Sanuma, and the current express -level side are overwhelming than the old fast.The development in front of the station is Imaichi, so it's a good station because the blue line is here!I like and use the vegetables of Kanagawa Hyeonsan. "
1186," When I went down near Sanuma and went to Azamino, I remember it was good to ride.The station did not help just to see the police from afar until the police came.I saw the nearby azamino station as a sign of the signboard, but I thought it was a very easy place to live because it was convenient and close to shopping.There are too many useless buildings and sites around the station.(12th year of the movie)/Originally a job.Nevertheless, it was for almost three years as an event agent on Saturday, not full -time.Since the residence is close to Chiba Prefecture, he was in charge of the field of field and the explanation of hospitality after shaking on the train for more than an hour including transfer.Even if I think of it now, I think it has continued.Instead of your current physical strength?It may be.It is a terminal station, but at the time, the downhill escalator was under construction, and the elderly had a very difficult idea.It is Yamayama, but I couldn't say that I could see it with everyone, so I was praying to be able to escalate somehow.I miss it very much ??? ./ There are revenge shops on the station, so the transfer is soft and the width is comfortable./ Shopping is also convenient for shopping.The bus also has a lot of routes, so it's always crowded.There is a bus stop.There are almost all functions.If you walk directly from the station, there is a forest.Why not develop it?At least I hope to build a station building or something in front of the station.The bus rotor is especially terrible./ There are many things, but the surrounding area is a bit old.(Especially north) There may be a task, but I feel the need for redevelopment.I think it's a waste to pass by, but I think it's a waste.…There are many people who fall more than they imagined. "
1187,"There is a lack of feeling, so it seems to be missing in a restaurant.There are many old people because there are few parking lots nearby./The stairs are 62 stairs from subway home to opening.From the ticket gate to the opening of the rural tutorial ticket, it is 31 stages.Occasionally there is an excavation on the premises/You can use both the subway and the JR, so it is convenient "
1188," Sorry.Seven -Eleven and UNIQLO are about 5 to 6 minutes walk from the station..It's not a bustling place, but the necessary facilities are easy to live.In front of the station, there is a big main field using expensive haits.(2021-10)/There was a convenience store and a gyu-dong shop in front of the station.I think there are dots./ Each station stop station.There is a family -style family restaurant, a documentary, and a pet shop.There is no detailed/no, no impossible, and it is a station for commuting commuting.There are few taverns near the station.I'm sorry that I had been before Corona.

1201," I think the restaurant is faithful!If you are cleaning, you doubt the method of cleaning and sanitation of the station.There is also in Shibuya and Nagatsuda. "
1202," students such as Kiri Academy, Japanese Sports College, Yokohama Tourne High School, etc.It is not only riding on each stop, and the late night is a stop at each stop, knowing that it stops, and the moment the Azamino passes, the mark disappears, and the next is Aobadai Station. "
1203,"I ride the Hanzo Mon Line from Nagatsuda Station, but always the radio waves of Aobadai Station are very bad, so all the systems of the terminal are downloaded from Aobadai Station.So it's always annoying.In addition to Aobadai Station, there is a very bad radio wave within the rural tutorial line, but this is the only way to do the system.In addition, the original system is not completely dropped even in the tano section.The rural areas are running in the same area similar to the Odaku Odawara Line, but the Odawara Line is quite good on the entire route.What is this difference just by moving a little east?Whether it was designed with thought ,,,/family trip, when I got off, I hit my face in my business bag when I touched Mt.

1366," Restaurants are also Fukohi.In the old days, it was a flower guy, but I think there are so many young people.It was a station.I have been around since ancient times./Because it's a Tokyu station, I have a supermarket../ Usually.High!/General Station/Maru Maru Sin Maruko"
1367,"You can see Mt.In particular, if you are outside the escalator, there is a long line of snakes and changing to Jordan Street and not suitable for the train time.The transfer stairs are also on the other side, and there are few passages to get on and off as a transit station.One or two trains are delayed.It is not easy for people to walk very much.However, the station is larger than the JR line. "
1368," \It was about 2-3 minutes to pass, but when I came out, I settled the entrance fee.There is no station in the opening, but I politely responded with the interphone.If you use this, it is thought that you can go to the Yokosuka Line in the Toyoko Line ticket gate without passing the station on Tsunashimagado without passing the signal of the Tsunashima Gado./2022 From December 18, 2012, Line 4 is added.Line 3 is only for rising, and 4 lines will be lowered.Although it is a construction to resolve congestion, the cause of the congestion is a lot of delays due to a human accident, so I think the installation of home gates is the same. "
1369," especially in the day of the weather, the green day is balanced and pleasant.If you don't wait for the next train, I don't care if you don't come to the train.There is no people in the current home expansion because it says that there is a lot of people by boarding the Sotetsu -ray.???? "
1370," due to historical situation, the grooves of the Yokosuka Line, the Nanfan Line and the Tokyu Line are famous for being strangely separated.It is one of Japan's three major Musako (the rest is Musa Shikoganay Station on the Central Line and Musa Shiyama Station on Tokyu Meguro), and locals are called Osugi.The staircase close to the naive ship's home is a matrix that cannot be lowered unless you wait a few minutes to rush.. "
1371, Why the hell is this uncomfortable making?Yokosuka line.Shonan Shinjuku Line.Sotetsu Line Direct 
1372, Line with Tokyu Megura.The main station of Tokyu Toyoko Line.It is about 400m hard on the distance of the transfer of the Yokosuka Line on the Nanbu line. 
1373,", I have been committed to the Odakyu and Nanfan Line, so I can know the mood well.But it's still on the way. If you buy a high -rise apartment, you make it a different area. It seems good, but Imai, but the fire potential seems to be.***************I've been relocated, but it's not a fun idea. Well, from now on, is there a distance. "
1374," Now the home is a passenger, and the home is very hard to return the home in the morning and evening.: "
1375,"./JR Magger has eaten my JR rail pass for 7-8 minutes alone with the Nabu and Yokosuka Line.It was the last day of use, but it was around 8 o'clock, so I could still use it for several more hours.I don't know if the machine is taking it after the expiration date, but I haven't taken it yet.I just told you to wait here.Many people were already waiting for other problems. The staff were looking at the office window without doing anything.I don't know who's there, but he was very cold just by trying to attract someone's attention.Well, I was late, I wanted to go to the hotel, I didn't plan to use the pass anymore that night, and I couldn't use it tomorrow (although it could be used that night).There are so many people waiting and the crew didn't do anything.But that should never happen.As long as I know, the machine should not use the JR Pass.Therefore, this station has not only employees (inefficient) but also major technical problems. "
1376," If you are a season, I think that the distance is a distance of one reverse.It is not possible to get off, and because it is on the way to the Yokosuka line platform, there is a strange place that is dangerous because the passenger (pedestrian) who always escapes to a certain number of times.Many, unnecessarily dangerous conditions were continuing. "
1377," continued to continue, the expansion work of the Neckline platform in that problem was being performed, but it was completed.Thanks to that, it's a bit, but the traffic width.However, since the space on the back of the stripped steel pillar is just downward, it is necessary to walk by blurring the back of the pillar in a row while avoiding the pillar.No. "
1378," If you don't know, it's better to ask the people around you or the station.The tremendous congestion of the morning and evening "
1379,"3.There are so many rides, which causes the delay every day "
1380, has no limitations.You Cannot Transfer Here with a lot of notice. 
1381," Home is very familiar.15 minutes needed to transfer/Tokyu Toyoko and Meguro were the transfer stations of JR Nanbu Line, but in 2010, the Yokosuka Line Home opened.It was improved, and in the JR, it became a base for advocating the third place in Kanagawa.The Yokosuka Line has its own grooves and a slope that moves through the transit passage.If you are a transfer of Tokyu ~ Yokosuka Line, it is fast, and in the case of the Nanbu Line and the Yokosuka Line, Muka Wara Station is close.The inconvenience of the inconvenience is not felt. "
1382," is becoming a capper over the surge of users, so the Yokosuka Line Home becomes a two -sided 2 -line, but the stop position is quite short.If you do not create an access to the ground (the reverse version of the weekday morning), people will focus quite a bit.It has become an uneasy structure.It is inevitable because the station itself is curved and cannot be held, but in order to promote the convenience of the northeastern part of the station (Kami Maruko), the opening of Tsunashima was installed at the end of 2023.This has made it easier to access the station in Tsunashima Gado, but the time is 7: 00 ~ 23: 00 time limit./ It is a bed town that has recently developed at once. "
1383," If you get off, there's a Musashi Kosci Toku Square and Gran Tree!Yokosuka Line, Shonan Shinjuku Line, Nanbu Line, Tokyu Meguro Line, Tokyu Toyoko Line, Meguro Line is more than a Mita line and boards on the north and south line.Is very difficult to use.First of all, the ticket gate, called the Yokosuka pioneer, is very narrow, and the morning commute is a procession in the ticket gate.Transit on other routes is very far away and walks 4 ~ 500m on the same JR.In addition, there is a part where the passage is thin and the leader is not thought of, and the group of the people coming from the Yokosuka line and the group of the people coming from the Nanbu Line have no choice but to cross.Laugh enough to think that it would be good to put a signal.Didn't you think that the front was blocked?The groove is narrow, in the morning, and the matrix of the thin, narrow escalator continues to exit the moving sidewalk, so it is strange that the accident does not occur.Did you forget that the escalator's reverse driving accident occurred a few years ago in this station?There is a fan near the entrance.one.It's not that big.Is this fan circulating the air of long passage and cooling?I want to teach JR for that righteousness.Summer is foolish "
1384, seems to have finally started making another home recently.It is not recommended to transfer from Yokosuka Line to Nanfan Line in this station.I am tired./
1385," shopping mall is also nearby.Mutual transit time is around 5 minutes from home to home.When you head from JR to Tokyu, the guide marks are difficult to break on the way.Saitama High Speed Rail, JR Half, Yokosuka Line, Shonan Shinjuku Line, Odorikoho, Narita Express, and Sotetsu Line are on board, which can be directly limousine to Haneda Airport. "
1386," Also in front of the station is a large -scale store that is convenient for shopping such as Gran Tree Musashi Course, Tokyu Square, Lara Terrace Musashi Osugi, Hoodium Die, and Ito Yokado. "
1387," while waiting for the train, this bad smell hell. "
1388, strange people who press the elbows or bump into meaninglessly on the train. 
1389,"The newly introduced parenting households will not be comfortable with life, and because they can't afford it, manners are unlikely to be expected. "
1390," It is easy to know the signboards of the home.Traffic is very dangerous.It is also seen in this place that the residents of Musashi Course and the poor quality of the Nanbu and Toyoko ships are bad.See more phenomena, think of it with your head, and put on paper. "
1391,"?However, because the movement is intersected several times, I have no choice but to move to the conflict. "
1392," in the peak time zone, the passage is completely blocked and the passage is completely blocked. "
1393, There are a lot of walking cigarettes and illegal dumps around the station. 
1394,? There are no commercial facilities around them 
1395,"I am doing it.There is an ion -like shopping mall in the province, but the quality of the goods is not good, and it feels like a product that seems to have raised the rent to the price, or it is a good thing.Many people have bought mansions around the station, but if you use this station, which is only a bit close to the office street in the province, you have lived in the province, but it feels strong.15 Currently, the elevator and escalator, which have been stopped under the influence of Typhoon 19, are not yet restored, and the up and down to the Yokosuka Line must use the stairs./ From Musashi Courses, Shinyokohama Station, Tokyu Toyoko Line and Shinyokohama LineDirect start!It's already 4 months!It was convenient to go to one of the nearest stations to Shinyokohama Station!The train is definitely a home, but the home station side calls another station and caught the shoes with a long caught rod (the same tool). "
1396," I think it was difficult to find because the shoes were falling in the invisible place under the home, but I am really grateful to the station and the other station.Thank you so much for the busy./ Yokohama's coming of Yoko Hama was hard to stand.If the upper and lower grooves are separated, it will not be taken./People who live on the nacing line are the most convenient way to go to Narita Airport.You only need to reverse it once.It is very convenient because there are express trains and slow trains.But be careful at the platform.It is said that only one direction of the upper platform can walk to the communication channel, and the walking time is almost 10 minutes. If you go to the airport on weekday morning, considering the flow of scary people who are scary on weekdays, you should have enough time to back up.Otherwise, it can be too late.The platform is also very wide, and even while waiting for the bus, Tokai and the Shinkansen will remain.!!!!!!/It became a convenient station.It is still around the time of Yokosuka Line Station or shopping mall.I miss you when there was only an empty place in the factory ground in the east.Is there any channel anyway ?? "
1397, is a word that is hard to live. 
1398, The family layer feels more likely than other lands and is the worst ... 
1399," This is Toyoko Line.PET bottles and cans are abandoned.In addition, there is a caution that don't throw away garbage.Since there is no garbage bin,I think it's strange.It will continue to be abandoned in the future.Nothing was purchased from the station, not home garbage.I think it's irresponsible.I would like to tell you not to sell it in the station unless you make a trash can.20230701/Yamada Kyoko, that's a developmental disorder. "
1400, No parking lot.There is a toilet.Non -smoking. 
1401," If you follow the route near the route, the direction is coming out, but you can't judge it as ""this!""N vertical discount management?/JR Yokosuka Line, JR Shonan Shinjuku Line, JR Nalfan Line, Tokyu Toyoko Line, and Tokyu Megu are very large.However, it is quite inconvenient to go to the JR Yokosuka Sun, JR Sonan Shinjuku Line, and it has no choice but to go through the JR Nabo Line's groove, and the JR Nanbu Line arrives at the home, and it is very returned to the passenger coming down from the train.There is no choice but to walk while avoiding it. "
1402," Recently, JR and Sotetsu ships have begun to board the mutual ride, and this Musashi Course Station is also the station of the junction from Hawasa and Yokohama through the cargo ship./ I am Tachika.I arrived at this train station from Washi to Yokohama, and I tried to get off at Musashi-Gusgi, another bustling metropolitan area of Tokyo-Kanagawa.It is hard to reach the station of Yoko Line.If you climb the Shonan Shinjuku Line, you will not come to the next time, and you will be able to afford it.The four system of the ride is boarded.Yokosuka Line, Shonan Shinjuku Line, and Sotetsu Line direct (Sotetsu, JR direct line) are the name of the track name Kamitokaido.As a luxury train via the Sinatsuru Line, the Yokohama of Narita Express or the afternoon of Narita Express, which is a luxury train to Shinjuku and Narita Airport, is stopped as a luxury train in the Tokaido Line..If you lower the Shonan Shinjuku Line, Narita Express was nervous on the opposite stop.Where?I think, but I can't find Osgi.Maybe it's a Musashi course.For those who do not know, I felt confused ./Pasmo.I bought it. "
1403," The Musashi KoSgi station has improved convenience by driving the JR Yokoska Line & Sotetsu Line.It was so crowded.I think it's a bit sorry that the Hibiya Line has disappeared, but I can transfer it at Nakame Guro Station.Transportation such as JR Narita Express is a good station.However, it is important to take a 10 -minute transfer time with a long passage (mostly walking) from the above routes and the Tokyu Toyoko Line.There are scattered places around the station.There are also many tower mansions.The armpits are running immediately, but the Tokaido Shinkansen is running, but unfortunately, the station is passed.It still remains ./ Using a moving sidewalk on the Yokosuka Line, heading to the exit via the Nanfan Line Home, but depending on the time zone, the congestion is severe, and it is messed up with the guests of the ride.Because it is a structure that passes through the bench when the expansion is, I wanted to be a structure that could pass through the bench.It is good to see more than a minute.There is a moving report, but it is difficult when you have a big baggage. "
1404,".There are a lot of tower mansions, and they have been damaged by the typhoon of 2019, so they are basically overflowing around grooves and stations.For this reason, the train passing through this station is very crowded, but the trains from the recently boarded Sotetsu direct line are basically empty.For this reason, if you go to Shinjuku, it is convenient to use a direct communication from Sotetsu.In addition, it is very empty to stop Narita Express, but because of the high rates, it is not very suitable for commuter means. "
1405," may be true in your closest station.Yokosuka Line, Shonan Shinjuku Line, and Sotetsu Line are a little far away, so the transfer is too far from the home of the Nanbu and Toyoko Line.In Musashi Courses, in a distant place that is no different from Shinmaruko.I think it would be embarrassed for the first time.be careful.Anyway, it was convenient to go in various ways, but it may have been more likely to stop the train due to an accident or a trouble.The shop has been increased cheaply and convenient./ Tokyu Toyoko Line, Meguro Line, JR Naval Line?As we cross, we can transfer immediately, but from the above route to the JR Yokosuka Line and Shonan Line, there are two things to walk through the nursery home or walk on the road in addition to the opening.(It takes about 10 minutes.) "
1406, I don't know this uncomfortable station./ Weekday morning is very congested.
1407," Reminds the gay urinary line used to go to the Akasaka Mitsuka or JR's Disneyland.When you go, leave enough time. "
1408," The cheering of soccer and basketball is flourishing./Because there is a warrior on the Toyoko line, it is exhausted in that far.Every morning, the home is very returned to a person, and the walking smartphone is depressed.It is the fastest passing through the station.Nanfish home throughout the morning is a bit annoying in the morning, but the chestnut is a little annoying, but it is recommended to Kawasaki.I knew that the time did not change much, so I didn't use it./ The Musashi Course was very convenient because it was redeveloped, but it would not take 5 minutes even if the Ian Line Yokosuka Line home was far away.It is highly recommended to take time to take time.3 minutes transfer is never possible.10 minutes is just good if you walk.I think it's no longer recognized as a station other than the transfer station./ I stop in the basement. "
1409, There is no need for a tunnel in the way. 
1410," But JR's Yokosuka pioneer is almost 10 minutes one way from the dogs of the naengu line or Tokyu, so it's almost a different station.There are few shops that can be shopping cheaply.You can shop for shopping.In addition, considering the transfer with the Southern Line or Toyoko Line, it is dangerous because people are biased to the north of the home.It is because of the curve, and the 10 cars of Shonan Shinjuku stop in the south.The transit passage to the Nanbu Line is made to the shortest, but considering the transfer to the Toyoko line, it is a place where you want to be in the northern end of the Yokosuka Line.It will also help you to relieve congestion.In addition, Yokosuka's pioneering ticket gate is said to be close to Mukawahara, which is the native ship.Naturally, it is not handled by transit, but the station premises are wide and difficult to understand. "
1411, It was very unpleasant. 
1412, I don't want to use it again.The ticket gate is too crowded.A structure that ignores human flow.It did not catch up with the increasing user.The convenience of transportation is a good station.You shouldn't be deceived by a real estate store.I can't help it because there is no land. 
1413," It may stop various lines, so I might be nervous about the transfer time.Nevertheless, it is a difficult place because the bench is less than the 15 -car train stops, and it does not go to sitting and waiting.. "
1414," It is difficult to run in the morning commuter rush, so it will be left to the flow.Following the 5th place user. "
1415,I don't want to ride. 
1416," It is about 7 minutes' walk.It is one of the most popular places in Japan as it is rapidly developing.The price of the house is quite high compared to other places.Transfer is inconvenient like the tokyo station in Tokyo Station.Rather, it is better to make the name of the station as a Coursegi station.It is convenient to do it./ I think the traffic is definitely very convenient, but the residents are over -over, and the balance of facility needed as a residential environment is worse. "
1417,There is no park plaza.I want to make and change the access from the home to the exit.
1418," \N transfer is a convenient and very good station, but it's too regrettable. "
1419,"'s masterpiece has also been renewed.There is also a big disadvantage of being disturbed by diamonds, but it is also different from local cities.Meguro line is a stop of Toyoko, Toyoko Line and Tong Tong, so it is convenient.Hiyoshi of Golden Week is "
1420," Kara Kara!Looking far away, this is inevitable on the wall, but there are too many sets of women and college students of women who are unhappy and bumpy.The transfer is also subtle.Toyoko is good for business, but as a result, inconvenience has increased.There are many rides in this station, so you can make a mistake. "
1421,", a portable battery has been broken. "
1422, no case 
1423," will be able to predict that it may be a relatively incident, and I think it is the inconvenience of the service provider. "
1424,"When the user has been consulting in this situation, it was the right manual to say, ""I put my mouth in a payment method that conflicts with the user.""If you are a mistake, you can teach you how to respond to it.It is possible to go to a distant place without a transfer. "
1425," On the first day of opening, I want to keep the manners and arrive in Shin Yo Kohama safely!!!/Keio's Hiyoshi teacher, middle and high school, etc.As the bus terminal moved, it was in front of a safe station, but it does not shine much compared to the transformation of university facilities.There is no degree of characteristics that can be said to be a student's street, and it is not a common people.I don't know.The entrance to the east of the station is a light and quiet atmosphere, but on the contrary, as soon as the west exit comes out of the station, the shops and many restaurants connect the eaves.It is very convenient because there is a ticket gate for transfer.It is inconvenient that the Toyoko line does not stop./It is an incident of 2009, but it is the case when I was riding the escalator of the gauio exit. "
1426,", Suddenly the escalatorI stopped so much. "
1427," I didn't walk the escalator, stopped and caught it on the railing.I saw a similar accident and thought about it. "
1428," I think it's usually banned when the escalator is stopped, but it was low.There is nothing such guide, and suddenly it stopped.Even after stopping, the two mechanics were looking far away and I didn't realize that I had been.It is basic.I want you to be careful because it's dangerous."
1429, Tokyu Toyoko Line stops express.
1430,", that is, the new residents who came to Hiyoshi and the semi -industrial area of the renewed clean residential area, but the city is a city that is mixed with a bad gala.It will be "
1431," Taxi focuses on people on the west outlet, but surprisingly, the east exit is empty in front of Keichi Yoshi Campus./Some of the attitudes of the station are bad for both men and women.Lack of knowledge and it takes too much time.Toyoko Line and Yokohama Subway Subway Green Line Station.No shopping malls are lined up./The distance of Keio University is an image. "
1432,"In the early morning walk, it was a mini -stop from Tsunashima Gado and went to the route that fell into Tsunashima.The grapes in front of the station include a picture and a sentence tile that introduces various nature and culture in Tsunashima.There are a number of bus platforms, such as the semi -interior.Reverse "
1433, Express stops 
1434,It's hard to understand if you're waiting for the side. 
1435,"u takes about 20 minutes walk to Shinyokohama, but to avoid the congestion of Kikuna,Some people walk from Okura to Shinsokohama.Yokohama Arena is near Okura Mountain, so I think it will be reasonable to walk in Okura Mountain..In front of the station, there are some shops, so you can go to the Okurayama Memorial Hall by walking from the station.station.(Among the works, Kokurayama) I have only been there once, but I think the atmosphere around the station was good./ I think that there is a lively but calm atmosphere because there are banks and restaurants around the station.It is about 5 minutes' walk to the ward office.Will it be a bit worrying about the narrow of the sidewalk?Nevertheless, it's not a big distance, but when I look at the number of people in the app's molester radar, I was surprised to be a lot of people compared to dozens.In the future, the radar will continue to increase the number of people.I just want to go bicycle shops.Since the criticism of the city is concentrated, "
1436,"Then.It was bigger than I thought.There is no in front of the station, the road is narrow and there is no bus terminal.There is a Tokyu Store in front of the station, so it is open until late.If you walk a little, there are libraries and supermarkets, and supermarkets are open until 23:00.After the opening of the Tokyu Sinyokohama Line, the number of transit passengers has been reduced.Because it is blocking this, it cannot be expensive, and the east entrance is about 4m wide, while it is said that there is no sidewalk in a one -way traffic.Since he was able to directly move to Shin -Yo Kohama on the line, he was able to directly directly directly to Shinso Kohama by the Sotetsu liaison, so his relative status as a transfer station was inevitably down.It is one of the miscellaneous stations that are very crowded without commercial facilities around the station.I don't know why this structure is, but the rescue statue is very similar to JR Shibuya Station.Rotary is not maintained near the entrance of the station, and the bus stop is coming to the just before the station.That's why it's hard to understand for the first guest.You won't imagine that there is a matrix of the bus stop to the stairs of the station.Anyway, I think there are a lot of passengers who use Kikuna Station, but there are few guests who have been around.Express, each stop stop station.Ground station. "
1437," Yokohama line rapid, stop station.Overpass. "
1438," The surrounding area is convenient for convenience stores, cafes, ramen houses, and Chinese shops in the east exit and the west exit.The luxury of the Yoko Line or the speed of the Yokohama Line stops! "
1439,".The bus from Kikuna to the Tsurumi station is also coming out every 5 to 10 minutes.There are many mansions in Kikuna, and there are parks in the Kikuna 1-2, which is also the boundary of the cemetery next to you.In the daytime, the side of Shibuya has disappeared during the day, but each station stops in the station, and the expensive F -liner is being connected.The fuck train exists all day, but after the revision of the diamond, the fuck train is installed except for the day, and the transit passage with the Yokohama Line is easy to understand/JR Yokoha and Tokyu Toko Line.Both sides stop the train, such as rapid and express trains.There are some situations that continue to be above. "
1440," The transfer is smarter, but Toyoko's side is so climbing and getting off again, but it is far away.Since the mouth is a one -way traffic, a preliminary investigation is required when you come by car.In addition to the trouble of traveling to the window several times without conveying the necessary matters at once, the reverse of the reverse was also unhappy.Even if I questioned the purchase of a regular pass, I received an early answer.I knew that nothing was solved even if I asked in this station.Reverse, pretend not to see!There can be no "
1441," I don't think it's inconvenient!Even though there was no train, I used the toilet comfortably to replace the children's diaper.The renewal of the Yokohama Line Home was not a barrier -free, but the transfer to the Toyoko line was smooth.But after the renewal, I feel as if the transfer line from Yokohama Line to Toyoko Line has worsened.Next year, Tokyu or Sotetsu will stop, but when the concert or soccer is held in Shin -Yo Kohama, the Yokohama Line is always crowded, so I want to put the home expansion, expansion, and staircase in sight.The history is new, but anyway, the narrow, old in front of the station, does not change forever.The decent shop is Ekima's bakery, tsutaya and Jonathan.There is no place for bus stops.The road is also rattled. "
1442," On the bus route, there are also a number of buses to JR Yokohama Station and the exit buses west of Tsurumi Station.Thrumi Station is a good way to use the bus.If it's a train, it is necessary to transfer to the Kei Hin Tohoku Line at Higashikanagawa Station. "", The worst station. "
1443, It is also difficult to cross the two adults. I want to move. 
1444," I really want to move.Therefore, you must transfer to other trains (Tokyu Toyoko Line)./JR, the transit of the document is also very convenient?It was somewhat comfortable because I was able to do it, but because I created a useless four -story building history, the round trip of the elevator is slow and the flow of people is still dull.After the remarks of the transfer only after the disappearance of the transfer, it is a crowded line from the morning to the evening.The day is hell. On a rainy day, the line of guests waiting for a taxi bus from the east exit to the west is no longer a specialty.In particular, even though there are many users in the city, we still use small entrances to the era of construction and continue to use it.It seems to be pleasant, but it will be in this state for the time being unless it is barely denied the sense of being made on a narrow land.There are very few places where you can eat snacks such as major fast foods, such as terminal station classes, and there are no charms other than the station.Is very dangerous.The first person may be a bit embarrassed by the transfer of JR and Tokyu./ It has become easy to use in reverse, but Shinyokohama lines have long been a long -standing transfer with Tokyu Shibuya ??????I think it will continue for a while./"
1445," from Yokohama Line to Toyoko Line, Toyoko Line to Yokohama Line, and it has become a long and very uncomfortable station.There is an experience, but the plane has a waves that walk quickly.I can do it in other stations, but I think that "
1446,"It has been opened with an image with the same flat plaza, such as the waiting place.I think this is easy to know.There is no one before the JR Yokohama Line.And there's no charging ATM like Seven Bank, so it's really one.Besides, there are many things that have been broken.Therefore, if you are charged, it is recommended that you leave a transportation card from the case or pouch in advance./ Since there is a long business time, it is convenient to become a strange building to the groove.There is no bus terminal, but the restaurant is not as attractive as the chain store on the floor. "
1447," I don't know what's going on, but I don't want to ride if the Yokohama line is boring after 23:00.In transfer, even in the transfer, even if you live nearby, it is less convenient because it becomes strong every day.It is convenient to go to the wheelchair side or Shinyo Kohama because it is preferred as an elevator.However, the walking of the transfer is reformed, and the stairs are badly deployed.Local lawmakers claim that they have improved, but they are not user.JR Yokohama Line was opened in 2018 and became clean.Tokyu Toyoko Sun is dirty overall.In addition to the Tokyu Store, there is a kiosk, but the commercial facilities are weak, including the surrounding area.The development and urban plan for railway companies and local governments are weak.There is nothing, despite a vast person transfers every day.There is an advantage of using the Toyoko and Yokohama Lines nearby.JR Yokohama Line and Tokyu Toyoko Line cross the transportation and easy use.There is a Tokyu Store before the opening, and it is open from 7 am to 1 o'clock in the late night.In addition, if you walk for about 5 minutes, there are also Gohoku Library and Summit Store.I don't want to move. "
1448,"It is a benefit of Tokyu on a variety of routes, and you can only go to all places on the 23rd premises with only a transfer of the home face face of the Toyoko Line.Shibuya, Shinjuku, and Ikebukuro, one with a bankruptcy.Kamata, Meguro, Ebisu, Roppongi, Yura Kucho, Ginza, Ueno, and Oji, you can go straight to Yokohama.In the Minatomiyamoto Motochi Motochi Town, there is a route bus from Shinyo Kohama, and there is also a transfer to Keikyu in Higashikanagawa.There are many hills around, and there is a limit of land use.There is no rotary or bus platform, no sidewalks, or narrow, will be difficult for children or old people.Recently, even though it is becoming a barrier -freeization of the station and becoming easier to use, it is necessary to be organized in the future.It is crowded with high probability.In the future, I think it will be resolved if Tokyu New Yokohama can be resolved, but it is a long time.You must use Shinkansen in Shinyokohama.It is very convenient because there is a Tokyu Store or Bakery where there is a Dokyu Store or a bakery.However, it is a surrounding environment that is not thought that the position is very bad and the station is stopped.Stopping is quite annoying, so you have to stop at the station.It is inconvenient to walk out to the entrance of the JR side (western exit).Like other Tokyu stations, redevelopment around the station is a difficult environment, so I think it is difficult for the station itself to develop.It is helpful to broadcast or mark it. "
1449," If you don't go to the ticket gate, it's unkind and unkind. "
1450," It may be true in your closest station.Lawson enters the station and is directly related to the Tokyu Store, so it is also convenient for commuting shopping.Despite the crowd of Mejakku tea, it is becoming more and more uncomfortable by the opening of the Mejakkucha.The staircase towards the edge, and it is very difficult to use, and it is because of that, and the leading vehicle in the direction of Yokohama is crowded.In the air battle that is said to get off the Yokohama line again. "
1451," is incredible, but the train starts earlier than the scheduled departure time (time written on the timetable timeIt may be different from.When I asked the staff, I admit it is a measure to prevent delay in other stations (!) Then I wonder what the timetable is.Why does the train do not need to arrive on time in this station?It is ridiculous to do this so that you can arrive on time to another station.Instead of telling JR's inaccurate departure time, we look forward to planning the time you need ...It was used around 11 o'clock week.It's crowded./The way back from Yokohama Arena always walks up to here.I was surprised that JR-TY's connection passage changed because it didn't visit for a long time.It's annoying because there's a lot of climbing.It will stop in the train and stop at the rapids of the Yokohama line..Tokyu Toyoko LineThe express 5050 is 8 cars and 4000 cars are 10, but the Tokyu Toyoko Line is not 10./ The JR and Toku Line are unknown while under construction.For the elderly or the body of the body, the subdivision, and the nanny cars, unkind station.It seems to be clean with the renewal in 2019. The Import Bus at the east exit of the Kikuna Station is a one -way traffic to the west exit of Tsumi Station through the old Tsunashima Gado.However, it is dangerous for the route bus to cross the Toyoko Line crossing, so it is not open and cannot be operated on time.This is because there is no plaza in front of Kikuna and cannot be done last time.In addition, the morning and evening in front of Kikuna Station is severe, and the crowds of Mt. Okura or Tsunashima can not be reversed.After the Tokyu Line and the Minato Miri Line were connected, the transfer became very convenient.It is hard to transfer at Yokohama Station./ There is no rotary place in front of the station.The bus is one of the stations that you do not want to use.It's hard to say that it was convenient after the modification?Especially in front of the station, it is really narrow and united, and inconvenient in the lane access./ It is a transfer station, so it is comfortable, but it is comfortable.You can add egg kawama toppings as a royal card, so it is beneficial.At a few o'clock, it is a crowded image./JR can be transferred. "
1452," The Shibusoba, which was gone in Shibuya, is located in Naka!There are also small cookers and snacks, so there's a distance from the show as if it's left alone! "

1457, It was famous that there was no pachinko shop around the station (laughs) 
1458," is rarely a local bakery, not Lawson or Seven Eleven.Since there are some wide opens, the installation of a home door is a rectangular station, and it is also a dangerous station.If you do not live on the home side, you will go to the opposite groove, so you have to go through the underground passage without a narrow and no escalator. "
1459," There is only one toilet and vending vending room.Isn't it good to carve it on another store?There is a toilet and air conditioning waiting room.If so, it was said to be called weightlifting.The prices are cheap, and there are many new college students and college students.Only in the station of Tokyu Toyoko Line.Only each stop stops, the toilet is only for Shibuya.Since it is a relative groove, you pass the underground passage to go to the opposite side.In addition, the central exit (western exit) is a mall.It is the station of each station stop by Toyoko Line, but there are a lot of elevators, and there is a toilet in the home of Shibuya.(In Corona Taema now) "
1460," in front of the station, the east side is narrow and one -way on the oral roadway in the west, and there is no space called reversal, and of course there is no Rotary.For this reason, there is no boarding as a route bus.Is there still a sense of show waga that hasn't been developed a little while ago."

1464," There is a fitness luggage in connection with history, so it is lightly shining in the early morning.If you are searching for the ear in the pre -chairman of the chairman, the voice -like voice scolded 'Walking Smartphone stops'.Is it caught somewhere?It should not be forgotten that the ticket gate in the uphill groove is installed as part of convenience and barrier -free.The structure that is directly connected to the mall and is directly related to the mall can be said to be the village of Showa.The uphill curve is also a place where the deputy manager suffers from opening and closing because of its bad vision.Students may live in a scene because coin lockers are faithful.There are two convenient public calls in case of emergency, so thank you so much.! "
1465, Do you only stop each stop compared to users? 
1466, A shameless response tone very angryThere is a lot of trash.Be careful. 
1467,"It is a station that only stops each station stop.Hyundai Kanagawa Technical High School is in front of the station.In the old days, there was a stop of Yokohama.There was a bowling alley, but there was no appearance.It is a walking book in Kanagawa -gu.If you walk a little, you can go to Kanagawa Higashi.Less than minute.

1468," ion, Maruetz, etc.?thank you ??All, let's use it clean ??/Yokohama Kami Aso Road.Perhaps because of that, the home width of Yokohama is narrow.The risk is lowered because it is now attached to the home door.Note that there is no toilet on the station. "
1469," The tongs of the train are quite noisy.There is an elevator, but there is no escalator.Maybe it's because it's because of that.What should I do?By the way, the toilet is outside the ticket gate.Outside the ticket gate, there was a stall before, but now it is not.Minato Mirina Chinese, Shibuyana Shinjukuna Saitama, can be passed without a transfer, but the express is not stopped, so local residents use transit in Kikunana Yokohama via Higashikanagawa./ Old beforeFrom Tokyu, there is a sense of cold.It is still worth noting that even the toilet is not on the station premium, but the dirty public toilet managed by Yokohama City is guided.It is good to have a home door.Three years later, in 1930 (Showa 5 years), it is underground between Dang Station and Banmachi Station in 2004 (Hessei 16 years).It is maintained as a resting course in the region.The river of the Katakura Machi is originally surrounded by the surroundings, passing through the station, but becoming a cancer from the two valleys.. "
1470,"It is a station that stops only on Toyoko Line.It is the closest role of the Kanagawa -gu government office and the Yokohama Bank Ice Arena.In 2004, a new groove was created underground.The old tunnel is maintained by Yokohama City and can be walked to Yokohama Station.It was the closest station of Sakata in Sakata, but unfortunately it was closed.It only stops at each station at the first station at Yokohama Station. "
1471," is used two times in a statue to finally arrive at home.Dang Station, which is not a transit station with the batting line, is the most deceived station except for Shibuya Station on the Toyoko line.It takes one minute to rush from the ticket gate to the home, so let's leave it with time./ The installation of the toilet that is spare "
1472," There are also elevators and escalators.I used it once and lowered it.The groove feels less influential after the basement.The first floor is convenient because there is a place where you can relax.Girls are fun.The depth of the home is usually in Hikari.Now, it's not a pleasant way to walk, but the maintenance will be gradually proceeded. "
1473," If you don't wander like this in a person station, it's recommended to meet in Vanachi.It's okay to rain because it's underground!But the express is not stopped./Here the Yokohama side becomes the underground section.So it is like a subway.The station itself is in the residential area.I want to say it!And if the express passes through the uphill and downhill at the same time, the wind is amazing./It's a subway station.It takes a few minutes in the ticket gate./ There are only benches outside of the ticket ticket, so it's convenient for rest.Is it the village where the old Yokohama is felt?It's leisurely good/it's hard to shop.
