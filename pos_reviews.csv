"
208," even Asakusa Station is a position that has fallen significantly from the other three Asakusa stations.A luxurious location with a sky tree in the street.Was it this happening?The overwhelming height is to attract people, so there is no difference in the times.I want to.People's flow is good and you can go straight to Senjoji Temple.It's quite far.I could do it later, but I don't think there is a role as Asakusa.At least, you should be called 'Shin Asakusa' or 'TX Asakusa'.Confused, deep underground and difficult to ride.Only Tsukuba Express runs on this route and runs between Akihabara and Tsukuba.!/There was an automatic currency exchange because of many foreigners!If you look into the elevator's exit between the roads, there was a clock with a stylish texture.I didn't know it because I always saw it.It is a and up and down theory.This subway line passes deep underground, so it takes some time to reach the platform, but if you don't rush, there's a wonderful mural that will be admired.There is also a lovely timeline that contains the history of Asakusa along the wall that leads to the exit.It is very inhuman to attract only three people side by side, so it is very inhuman, and there are many Kaminarimons and Skytree and many tourists.There is a hotel and a restaurant near the station.When you enter the basement, the picture drawn in front of the station is really cool!When the seed was in trouble, he was very kind.Thank you very much.In the same Asakusa station, Dobu was unkind because it was recommended to use TX.It feels comfortable because there are shops nearby and many restaurants nearby.The toilet is on the inside of the door.Since it is not the Asakusa Station on the line, the user is noticed.

It's quite far, so it's uncomfortable.It's the first time I came to a tourist, so I can't answer even if I listen to it./I walked more than I thought.If it is completed in 1890, is it 23 years of Meiji?Meiji's speed feeling is amazing.

"
216," The passengers felt something less, but I would like to be more likely to be a railroad for people living in Tsukuba.That is not alone.It's quite far from Dobu Skytree Line and Ginza Line Asakusa Station. "
217,"PLEASE Check Your Posts!It is heard that it has become an active name due to local hope./ The platform takes more time to move to the train deep underground because it must move under all other routes between Akihabara and Asakusa.However, the station itself is very good and there are many wonderful pictures that show the tradition of local life and Asakusa./ The name is the same but the subway line is two subway stations.It is especially confusing for foreign residents (like me) who are new to tourists and cities.Thank you for telling you the appropriate sign!/It's in Tito -gu, Tokyo.

280," The train stops the express or quasi -level.I am sorry./It is the station of Dobu Dodge at the north end of the city.There are department stores such as OIOI, so public announcements have benches, so you can be very calm in a large space.I feel a lot. "

282," may have many problems, but create a good Cannes elevator.../ Really attach an elevator ... "
283,"Starting from the station, I wanted to solve the question of the past when I found a connection because of the focus of interest in Asaka Station and North Asaka Station. "
284,"I think Dai Station is high, but according to the evaluation of the road railroad, it seems that at this point, it seems to be prioritizing Asaka Station.Regarding the relationship with the national railway (Japan National Railway) surrounding the route, it was written in word of mouth of North Asaka Station, so if you are interested, please read it. "
285," If you look at the HP on the Home Door, the HP on the Home doors is in progress, and until the end of 2020 (2021/03/31)According to the January 8, 2020, Asaka Station is starting from March 14, 2020, with 1 and 2 homes.Since the shooting economy of the Tokyo Olympics is done at the Athletic Self -Defense Forces Training Center, it seemed to be renewing Asaka Station, one of the nearest stations.They seemed to have been planned sequentially since the Tokyo Olympics were held in 2013.In the 1964 Olympics, the shooting game would have been held at the Athletic Self -Defense Forces Asaka Training Center.I remember faintly. "
286,"?I knew it, and it became clean in its own way. "", 20200822 "
287," Dobu Dodo Line is Tokyo Metro Yuraku Cho Line, Fukuto Fresh, Tokyu Toyoko Line, Minato Miri Line, Tokyu Sinyokohama Line, Sotetsu LineTetsu Izumi route) and direct direct driving, and indirectly driving with Seibu Yuraku, Seibu Ikebukuro Line.There is a transportation network that is said to go to China.It is a transit station of the JR Musashino Line.The home is 2 sides in the connection station with the rapid express.It is the station of Joseon. "
288," There is a small Rotary and restaurants in front of the station, especially if there is no impression, but if you are a little away from the station, it is a pleasant place where the roadside road continues. "
289,JR Musashino Station with North Asaka Station is a transit station.I only wanted to increase the number of passengers by hand. 
290," If so, I think the same station was good.This is here when you come to Dobu Dodgeon.There are bookstores, tories, and Kentucky on the station.However, in the morning and evening commuting and returning rush, the staircase of the opening of the car and the transfers of the free -free route and the allowable amount of the escalator to be passed through the visitor moving through the visitor.It will be Maz to prevent it for the construction, but you can do it more."

292," Dobubu -do is a express.There are many guests of the Musashi Line.Poor/Morning commuting time is that there are many transit passengers with North Joseo Kasumi Station, so the number of kicks is not cleared, and it is more than a crowded guest and a burning guest.And the toilet smells.I can't believe that I'm looking at the atmosphere.In the word of mouth in Asakadai, the Northern Asaka Station on the nearby Musashino Line is surprised because of the opening of the 40s.It's natural now, but at the time, I didn't see it in the same way, rather than the same national railroad.Perhaps Kansai Silver Silver has spread quickly.Do you have a home door, and you are thinking about the safety and convenience of the passengers?It was a place where there was nothing other than the field, so if there was no warrior in Urawana Omiya, there would have been nothing to use this station.Finally, I realized recently, but the express is stopped with gender and wakoshi, but I go to Asakadai without stopping at Asaka with City Hall.Isn't the person of Asaka citizens uncomfortable?It is a sign near the station, and it seems to be called carat town.It was a strange sign that ginseng was pleased with ginseng fields and crowded streets.You can transfer to Asaka Station, so you can take Dobuto Chosun to go to Kawago and Ike Bukuro.If you take a Chinese traffic, you can go without a transfer. "
293," The use of wheelchairs is very inconvenient, and it is necessary to stop the escalator of a great user by calling the station without a slope.At the time of the opening, there were only two stations, and all of them were only fields.So the miserable thing is that the groove is crowded because there is nothing to block the expensive North Jose Kasumi station, and when the rain or snow falls, the sand blurres when the wind blows.I was doing it.After a long time, it's a surprise development.The history has also changed, but I was a little relieved because there was a shop of Kentucky Pride Chicken since its opening.I don't think much about pioneering, but the bar is moderate, but it can't be compared with the neighboring station.Man is convenient on the right.So when I move the stroller, I was using the side of the side of the side.Rush is crowded, but it is recommended to go to Tokyo or to go to Kagogo rather than use the Saigyo Line of Musashi Urawa.It's not difficult for meals, but it's not noticeable except for supermarkets.In the morning and evening, there are quite a lot of people.Among the Dojo ships, Ike Bukuro and Wakoshi are the many lifting stations.Stop here.Ikebukoro, Ogao and as if they were in the way, stop here.You can transfer from Dobuto Chosun to Musshahhhhhhhhi (JR) Sun KitaAaka Station.Other Asaka Station is just a 2 -minute walk from this station./ The guest floor is not good.Details/??…/If you go to a stroller, it is very inconvenient because there is no elevator and slope at all.There is a phone button next to the escalator, but you can feel it.It's scary to burn a stroller in the escalator, so I want it anyway ....I am happy to have a Kentucky Pride Chicken shop./ I went to La Lafoto, so I rode it from Thrusee Station, but when I handed it away because I wanted to have a stamp, I fell into the groove inside the train.If there was no role in Asakadai, it was paid again in terms of frowning.It is very bad.Details/Yakitoriya or many restaurants are very bright and prospered.And since there is a canteen on the station, I get off the newspaper (O^-^O)/Bakery, Kentucky Pride Chicken, Bookstore, Tori, Tongtong, and Viad Dad in the station.It is convenient because it is not stopped, but it is not stopped, but it is not stopped, but it is not stopped, but it is also directly in the Moto -Machi, China, and Shinkiba, which is exiled to the Kawago of the express or quasi -level and cross sheet specifications.In particular, there are six buses in the Hibari Kaoka Station on the Seibu Ikebukuro Line, so it is convenient because there are 6 hours per hour, and the express bus in Haneda airport is also located.It has been owed since I was in high school./It is a good match with North Korea./I use it as a transfer of the day. "
294, I take a good take -out and return home in Bias dad and Kyotaru in front of the ticket gate.The station broadcast is extremely noisy.It is a transfer station with North Asaka Station on the JR Musashino Line.

297," Ayaka Festival 8/4?~ 8/6? ./ Asakashi is the center of Asakashi, but Tow Chosun does not stop rapidly, but it is said to stop from the diagram of March 23.There is a place to play around Asakanomori.! "
298," with a surreal picture, I am cool.There are Equia, or there are sour circles, dako, and cute grocery stores.And there's a coffee shop in a pretty good bookstore.However, there is only one place in the countryside, but there is only one good place in the program.Before the boom, he's a friend of the heart of Kasumi.There is no other festival.Even if you don't have a pachinko, I hope you have a more convenient building or an ion mall.And, above all, the bus was so digested that the bus was so scary.. "
299," It is convenient because it is in a friend or a favorite bakery.In addition, I can ride the express train to Ikebukuro Station. "
300, I want to use the express train in the future.

303," The history itself does not change, but there is also an installation of an elevator.It takes a few years, but I think that Asaka is really clean./ The southern exit is well maintained, so it's clean.There are many schools with Asaka High School, Asakanishi High School, and Shinja A High School.It was convenient for express stops, but it was necessary to stop.../ Do not stop the express to the morning Kasumi, where there are few users!! "
304," The next diary revision would like to be a station that usually stops.It's a totally tastes at all, but it is the station of the beloved Dobu Dodge.The bookstore has disappeared .../Kori Yamada Kabao.It arrives immediately. "
305," passengers who are not used to railroads are confused.Therefore, there is a signboard with the intention of ""The transfer to the JR Musashino line is the Asakadai station.""It is the sixth largest in the bronze station.It is used by the largest number of employees in the station where train species are passed over express.Since 2005 (Hessei 17 years), it has been shifting to an increase.I used a font of the universal design response I wanted to ./ The express was stopped!If Echia's size is a bit bigger./ There are quite a variety of shops.

"
320," Nevertheless, I was able to catch it in my own way was interesting in the process of changing, position or understanding of the situation due to the background of the times, and the process of consensus by wisdom and compromise."
321," Wakoshi Station is a co -use station where Tokyo Metro and Tokyo Metro (Yuraku -cho Line and Fukuto Fresh) share the premises, and the road railroads are in jurisdiction.I rarely know if it is.For example, the home door of 2 and 3, which is used by Tokyo Metro, is started in 2012 as a specification of Tokyo Metro (Yuraku Cho Line, Buddhist).In contrast, in the case of Dobu Dogson, a home door of the Dobu Dodojo specification is installed in 2016.It is divided into various details.Even though there is a staircase and up and down, it is easy to transfer because it does not need to go through the ticket gate.(The process between this is too long).In 1983, the Yura Kuku Line opened between Ike Bukuro Station and Subway Narimas Station.And in 1987, the mutual ride was realized through the subway Narimas Station and Wako City Station.In the meantime, from Wakoshi to Shiki, we are doing double -track construction.In addition, Waco Gum Tea (construction in 1980) is made as a dedicated Tokyo Metro (originally Yuraku first).(In Tokyo Metro, it seems that the meaning of the construction of a dedicated Wako Gum Charge is great.I remember that the bankruptcy will be directly driven by the mutual operation.The 12th Japan Railroad Award is awarded to the mutual direct driving by the 7th Minglin. "
322,"littleI think I could understand it.Oitashi has been elapsed, but Wako Gum Tea is also made in the US military facility.There was an impression that has been taking a different manner than the municipal village in the neighborhood, but it seems to be carrying out its independence.If you have a chance, I think about using it near this.The grooves in the Ikebukuro and the subway on the 3rd and 4th lines are very crowded, but it is a little relieved because the home door is attached. "
323,"If you can sit at Dang Station, you can sit at Dang Station, but the number of people slowly rides at the next subway Narimas Station, and therefore, on the Kyugyu train to the Toyos Station, therefore, if you want to sit and commute to the Kyugyu train, ride the train of the Dang Station, and in Narimasa Station, Narimasa Station.It is recommended to sit before arriving.Chosun "

330," bus.There is no line to the adjacent cordashi, and in order to go to the city, you must bypass Narimas Station or Railroad next to it.Passengers are more likely to go to Kago than here, so they need to greatly increase the direct communication of Tow Chosun.Since the subway is only stopped, the groove is overflowing with a person and cannot be moved.As the construction work is in progress, the position of the ticket or the ticket of the valley has been changed.Since the station building will be built, it is more easy to use if it is possible.I hope you can do it quickly (Laughter)/The reverse building completed in addition to the convenience of the three -line, the starting station, and the express truck station is very attractive with the commercial facility in front of the station.The station became Waco City by renaming the station name.The station premises have withdrawn the tenant, and now there are many places that are becoming a shutter store.Originally, Tokyo Metro Station was not scheduled to install a station, but there was a past that was in the station that was in the station by compromising with the local area because I wanted to build a garage..

358,"Maybe it's abandoned, I don't worry about it!Like Koma Gome Station, there is a high difference in east and west.The east exit includes Seven Eleven, Gast, and Kitchen Origin, but the west exit is Lawson Bay./ Fukuto Fresh, Yuraku Choseon ~ Tobu Torjo Line, Seibu Ikebukuro Line, Tokyuku Line, and Sotetsu Line.It's not a large station, but I think the number of users is large.There was a chance to ride the 40,000 series of Seibu by chance, but it was a vehicle for this year, air purifier?Plasma cluster is installed!!!/It is a station that is often used for transfer. "
359," There is no store near the station.On the other hand, in front of the station, there is no commercial facility to be special, but it is a transit -oriented station.I think it's a good idea to act with time because you think you will hesitate to ride a train to ride.If you are heading toward Seibu Ikebukuro Line from the basement of the street, you need a lot of cases that require a transfer.It became convenient because of less time.Yura Kucho and Seyi are also on board, making it a small terminal station.I think the user is in quite a lot.There are many residential areas, and there are many lives of salaryman and student alone, so there are many times in the morning commute and evening.The bankruptcy and the Yura Cushun Line are very convenient and very convenient.The express also stops, so there are many users of transfer.The vending machine is convenient because it is in some grooves.The toilet is also in the ticket gate at both ends.The bench is also convenient because it is installed at the back of the home.There are few commercial facilities around the station, and I think most of the locals are used outside the transfer.The walkway is good for walking along the streets of Yomachi.Honorary trains such as "

361," is a favorite place.As an impression, it is unkind compared to the use of the disabled or the elderly.I want to attach an escalator too.Ikebukuro is about 5 minutes, Shibuya Shinjuku is about 20 minutes.Some people are lacking, but it's not bad for a place to live.However, it may be a dangerous event or a quiet distance, so it was very cozy personally. "
362," was also a clean and good impression.It is professed to proceed with the barrier -free as a barrier, but in this station, an elevator was installed from the ground at the entrance near Ikebukuro.Isn't it possible to say that it's still a barrier -free?In particular, it has been improved quickly because there are many wheelchair users.It is a very convenient station to go to various fields such as Shinki Baro, Ike Bukuro, Shinjuku, and Shibuya to Yokohama.When you get on the ground, you have an elevator and an escalator.

"
366,".The exit near Ikebukuro has an elevator, so thank you for those who are uncomfortable.Since the Sei and Tokyo Metro Line 2 are both merged from this station and separated after this station (Ikebukuro, Nerima, and Wakoshi), this station is probably the most complicated station in the subway system in Tokyo./It's a fun section.After entering Ita Bashi -gu in the city, Nerimagu.This station is Nerima!I thought it was Itaba City.I have been going to various places so far, but this is the first time I want to take a picture of the subway and take a picture.

I was very nervous because I couldn't even do it.I can.On the platform I was sitting.I felt deeply how great the Japanese people's compliance and consideration were.Without a cell phone, you wouldn't have known what to do on the next trip.I hope the enthusiastic woman knows that I have found a cell phone.(She later went to catch the car.)Thank you ~ Thank you Japan ~/It's always crowded but convenient!

405," There is a wonderful movie theater such as Toho Cinema Ikebukuro and Grand Cinema Sunshine on the east exit.Personally, I think 4D movies are the wins of the Grand Cinema Sunshine.In addition, the scenes like Akihabara are seen a little, and the sub -culture is infiltrating.In addition, there is no details, but it seems to be full of women's products, and the deacon cafe is also popular.Please come to play!The station is adjacent to the department store.There is a Tokyo Art Theater and Rikyo University.It's convenient to know on the station!

410,"However, it was mixed and said that it was recovered at the end of the end, but there was nothing to check again without repeat.I wanted to leave a review of Vikuro Station, but I couldn't find a marker on the map.In addition, the platform itself is on the first floor, and the toilet is only on the first basement floor, so you have to go down the elevator or escalator.Half of the toilet is during the renovation work (April 2023), so the line is very long.It's a pity that there's only one toilet./They is also a question of a lot of lines that have been stamped in rabbits for 10 years ago.Bean course capacity is overwhelming.Standing soba jade zone becomes healing.You can enjoy it all day without getting tired of cinema, meals, fashion, and play.

413," I feel a mess when I go near the live house with full makeup.The station with the best bus route, Dobu Department Store is centered on the bus lines of the International Heung -Up Bus, and Seibu Department Store meets the bus lines of Doyoung Bus.The atmosphere is very good and you can enjoy it alone.It is a very convenient station because it is the first Tokyo city of Ike Bukuro Station.I was in a limited express because I went to Chichibu. "
414," came to Ikebukuro only two or three times, and I heard it from many people.If not, it was good because the window can be enjoyed with glass to the bottom of the foot.At the home of JR Yamanote Line, you can see Dobu Dodo Line, which was originally the area, so you can shoot your favorite vehicle personally.By Christmas, Illuminations are clean.It is quite a big station in Japan!

418," If you get out of the way out of the Yuraku first → Marunuchi Line, you will see the second gate.You must escape the crowd of Seyumin walking towards JR along the stairs.But it's better than first.Obviously, the opposite is naturally naturally.I finally thought it was a traffic, but I didn't have any signs.But this time it is not on the line and platform.Perhaps because of the building structure, Lumine was not found and hovering around it.It is hard to see because of the pillars, and even if you follow the signs, you will lose your current position and your current position at any moment.However, it is at least good for information staff.Difficulties are to find the right exit.It is very clean like almost all train stations in Tokyo.Since I go to Chichibu, I got in a express because I went to Chichibu."
419,"I was very bad because I drove in the reverse direction.I'm sorry that it's not a regret?It is dangerous if I pay it here, so I think it's good to go to the 24H business Mac.Thank you for your long sister.Homeless people can catch it.There are many troubles, but sometimes people in the station are doing care of people who need support."
420," was prioritized to building a great headquarters building in Ikebukuro before the home door.// Even if it was born or growing up, it is a completely biasing evaluation, but in the village where you are in the village,Since it is a hub station connecting, it may not be an excess evaluation.When I was young, I was pounding just to go to Ikebukuro, but it changes my senses again.If you know a lot of time, you will be born?It's fun.There are routes such as JR, including the Railway, Seibu Railway, and the Tokyo Metro Marunochi Line Yuraku.It is well known as a world -class giant terminal, but there is a road railway at the west exit of Ikebukuro Station and Seibu Railway at the west exit.There are two underground passages of the new district to connect the east and west.Each underground passage is connected to different subway lines, which requires enough attention.There is also a guide mark, but in unknown cases, I think that the information on the information center will reach the destination as soon as possible./ All of the stations with the best railway and bus lines in the metropolitan area, Dobu Department Store is centered on the bus line of the international Heung -up bus.Seibu Department Store is a bus line on the Doyoung Bus, is the restaurant faithful?It seemed to be participating. "
421," I like the big camera's CM song, and I heard thousands of times.It is a very good song. "

424," ※ Data is cited from JR East Japan HP.(The number of passengers does not include the number of people getting off, and the number of people is not included.) In addition, I do not think that the troops and metro legs are not included.It is possible to add other troops, including Seung -ha, and Metro.Dobu Railway was May 1, 1914 (Dai Show 3 years).Seibu Railroad was April 15 in 1915 (Dai Show 4 years).The Youngdan subway was January 20, 1954 (Showa 29).It was a bit complex because Ikebukuro Station is a bit complex because it is composed of the station in the underground passage."
425," because the west exit and the Seibu side are the east exit, the person who wants to go to Sunshine is fine when it comes to the east exit where Seibu is.This time, I headed to Chibu with Seibu's express. "
426," ② I took a picture from the traditional coffee shop at 9F at the east exit.Dangerous.You may suffer from a variety of people and a number of respondents.There are many other things, but I think it's cute to play a station.Do your best.Porter ”has become a specification./ especially JR's conductors are severe and do not want to be lowered by transfer.I hope to improve the transfer guidance.There is also a torque or convenience store, so you can buy a trip until just before departure.The main will be a window that is greatly open to your feet.The chairs are also pleasant, and they are more likely to be on board overseas, rather than Japan's expresses, so they make the trip further. "
427,"The glass window in front of you likes the smoked specifications and a very full -hearted ride, so one of the content you want to actively want to go to the rich department is enough!!/Seibu Ike Bukuro Station was boarded at the express. "
428," The groove of the train has a dedicated groove for the express train, so the purchase of the express pass was very smooth. "
429,"Even if the seats are also comfortably, the legs are comfortable, so the ride must be. "
430," It is a different place because the toilet of the gold soil is lined up.It's fun to be happy./ at least I want to change it to the tranquility of the morning melody morning of JR Bukuro Station.It is calm for commuting.On the 7th line, the feeling of passing through Munseok or Park is the world's third Guinness record.(In addition, Shinjuku Station, 2nd Shibuya Station) If you think in the Seyi and Dobuto Chosun, the number of passengers is the first place.It's hard to remember anymore, and it's easy to remember. "
431,"There are many restaurants, so some people visit for food purposes, and there are many entertainment including animation.It is also fun to have a lot of other shops on the night. "
432," It is a big city that is not tired of showing various faces.It is very convenient for the countryside that is very difficult to understand.The premises are neat layouts, making it easy to use.As the role of the Seyun Line, the number of elevators is NO.1.Since ancient times, it has been used as a connection from Seibu Ikebukuro Line, or because of the recent workplace, it has become a commuter right.In the future, holidays will be used to increase more frequency than Shinjuku Station.Despite the two -stage grooves in the start of Dobu Dodojo, I have won a speed of 50 to 60 km and feels quite powerful.

"
434,"It is convenient because it is sold in the basement price.Keep in mind that.For me, this station is the busiest station that can be handled comfortably, and the reason is:There are many people, but they are not as crowded as other stations.There are still many shops where you can walk around, find a station exit or specific lines, and look around.It is lively, vital and pretty good. "
435," If you speak with the number of elevations, there are many Shinjuku stations, but all the people in the transfer or the people of the east exit and the west exit are gathered together.I don't want to do a small sophisticated redevelopment.Today I am confident that I am looking forward to seeing what badly feels..I just caught up with the events that citizens participated.I sell a lot of street foods./JR's Ike Bukuro Station is like Umeda Station 10 years ago.There is still an elevator with Showa, Hessay, and Ray.

"
441," If you come to Ikebukuro once, the all -round feel that you can go anywhere is invincible! "
442," The street itself is not a good place for honesty, but the station is easy to see and the route is easy to know.It is a terminal station and it was very convenient in connection with department stores such as Seibu.If you go up from the basement, light up with blue and white electronic decorations.

1321," high -end station with 6 lines of 6 lines.It is a branching point of the main and airport line.It is a three-story structure that places the gate floor (4-6 lines) on the first floor, the second floor (4-6 lines), and the downhill groove (1-3 lines) on the third floor.On the second and third floors, the same shape's grooves (later) overlap up and down.It has a tinnitus of ""Kamata Fortress"" from this profound structure [20].The northern part of the theory also spans Kamata Sancome beyond Kusu Kawa, but there is no ticket gate on the north side.On the Haneda Airport, to Yokohama at Haneda Airport, and the 4th line, Haneda Airport in Yokohama and Sinagawa at Haneda Airport will stop.After branching with the main line, the interval between the Sithsus crossing near the side of the side of the side is in the form of a single line parallel (to this part).Sithsus Crossing is in this position because line 1 and 4 are located on different floors and cannot be installed right near them.In addition, when the Sinagawa is reversed when the operation is united, the train of the Keikyu Kamata from Yokohama arrives in the 4th line, moves towards Villa, and then crosses the Sithsus crossing, proceeds, proceeds.Change the direction to enter the first line, change the direction again, and return to Yokohama.There is.On the outside of the groove of 2 and 5 lines, there is a passing line of 3 and 6 lines, allowing for an evacuation (evacuation).In addition, when the winning line 2 is passed through line 3, it is necessary to pass the 6th line after the kick from the 5th line.Line 5 was already completed at the time of 2010, but did not disclose the public.

"
1338," Some of the platforms show multiple destinations (e.g. Platform 4).As a foreigner, I thought I mean each train stopped on the platform to these two.But not.This means that the train to different destinations uses the same platform.If you don't check the billboard, you can also board the wrong train!If you go to the airport in a hurry, the situation may be bad.The airport express that stops at each airport line is the 4th line on the second floor.This 4th line is a song that requires attention because the agency of the Japanese airport is also stopped at this home.Since it is currently being an event, I think this sign (see photo) is listed.It is recommended to check the guide marks of the station.!If you leave Haneda Airport, some of them stop at Keikyu Kamata Station, but the airport pleasant will not stay in "

1340," The street landscape is once a crowded pub streets across JR Gamata Station, but now it is a completely calm atmosphere.Of course, as you get closer to JR in the stone, you will see a kamata.Since there were a lot of airport officials around Kaikyu, there was a different atmosphere than Kamata, but I think it was more clean by the recent redevelopment.It seems to be more exciting because it seems to be able to open it nearby.There are two types of escalators going to 2F and going directly to 3F's grooves.I was embarrassed because I had to ride after checking on the bulletin board in advance.It is recommended to be used in time.In addition, there is a distance from JR and Tokyu Kamatha Station.Since the front is the distance of the basic base workers, the security is not good, the burger that was in the morning..The groove is a two -story building, and the grooves for each station stop by the Yokohama side are difficult to know, but there is a polite annunability.There are main ships and Haneda ships at the station/Keihin express station that is easy to use and easy to use.It is about 10 minutes on foot to JR and Tokyu Kamata Station.

"
1346,"On May 16, 2010, the high -priced lines were raised on the second floor, and the descending line was deployed as it was in the past, but the downward line of one wealth, which constructs the home or line, and lower the party, uses a temporary high -priced line.The crossing of the Fantasy Line 8 was resolved. "
1347,"Instead of the delight of the main line between Kawasaki, instead of the exception of driving, the only single ""Airport Express"" was added.The uphill line of the high -priced topic, the trouble of the land, and the crossing of the crossing to the Bonggok, were delayed, and the pleasure from Hae Sinagawa evaporated, and [Airport Express] to Yokohama was faithful every 10 minutes."
1348, is awesome ??/The foot line is designed.

1352,".Handa Airport has a lot of reverse express exiles with Yokohama Sinagawa, so there are quite a few numbers, so it is difficult to know.The same was true, but it was changed to the topic of Yakult 1000 vending machines.I was surprised by the popularity. "
1353," As a station, it was clean and wide, and in addition to the train of Keikyu, I can see the Asakusa Line or various cars, so the children I like are generally.I think it's a confusion because there is a stop on the floor.You can't know which home you need to be confused by a local.There are a lot of people who listen to the station.I think // people from foreign countries, and were shooting a fortress over the window at the timing of the right curve in the nigga.It's a very way to build it.Finally, I'm used to it.The 2012 Good Design Award.The 10 -walking quartile to JR Kamata Station is located.

1354," ★ has become a clean history, so [5 stars] \In the old days, I was changing every time in the kamatawa station, but for example, the train from the airport (Kumori Inari, Odori, Hoya) to Shinagawa or Kawasaki is also comfortable because it is a switch bag without a transfer in the kilns../ Recently, when you go home, the asthma does not stop.The iron of the iron rose too much?After washing the window and the car, the iron is gathered immediately.It rarely does not arrive at the exit.The first person is wandering, a three -story building!There is a guide to the airport on the ticket layer, but since the platform is layered, it is often not possible to ride even if it is marked.In order to run to avoid riding, I always think it is good to review the guidance of the difference.The previous image is also renewed.Since the layers are divided by each side, transit, etc. If you don't have time to afford it, you will be embarrassed.It may be good for escape from reality…/The role of the Keikyu Line, there is also a Haneda airport from this station.There is a mall in front of the station, and about 15 minutes on foot, Lion Illustration has a Kamata Onsen of the target..It is used to go to Haneda, but you have to climb a long staircase only when you are in a hurry.I don't like.The second and third floors are inconvenient.I want to go to the airportWould it be good to use a direct position as much as possible?Because of this, it may not be uncomfortable to live long.Rather, there are quite a lot of plus α elements, so I have a lot of tiredness. "

In comparison, it is inorganic, but it is not simple and structurally wandering.This is the side of Yokohama, but there are things that are changed by the situation. In the airport, the floor of the groove is changed by the difference.The N -ticket gate is on the second floor, and there are escalators that go up to the third floor and the escalator directly to the 4th floor. This should also be used carefully. AMA. ITSan inorganic structure, but Its Simple that You WONT LOST in the station.

"
1357," Examples of complicated bizarre: \It is different from the notch part of the side of the Yokohama side (No. 6: the arrival of each station).Light, for the first time, I think it's a very difficult groove for users?It is often used as a wonderful and beautiful station with trains that can go to international airports.Line 5 of each station stops is hard to know.Is it Umega Shiki in the old days?And I want to rush. "
1358," If you change to Haneda Airport Line, listen to the announcements and be careful because the uphill groove is ahead or the downhill grooves on the top of the layer are also in front of you.In addition, Haneda Airport Line Home stops from Tokyo, Chiba, or Yokohama and Yokosuka, so please check the point.

I was surprised at so much beauty.Design, lighting, building, ceiling picture ... It was really fantastic and it is still.Take it wherever you go to your destination like a city trip.There are also trains on Line 4 and Line 5 for express, and free transfers are faster than local trains such as Line 6.Even if you stand under the beautiful constellation on the ceiling, you will find out what the main lobby is.While in New York, everyone should try to walk this beautiful building./ Well .... impressive.It is soft and clean and has a bathroom and a nice arched oyster.It must be completed.And Saturday/Sunday is a waste of time.MTA is a joke.??It's not a safe place…/A wonderful building that can be around.It's ashamed, but they agreed to put the Apple Store in it.It is worth seeing and there are various foods and drinks options.It was much more impressive than I thought!/Very well managed and preserved terminal.I'm in the movie.The ceiling has a constellation and lights drawn like stars.It is a large terminal.The glorious main hall, decorated with Tennessee's marble floor and Italian marble ticket office, is covered with an arched ceiling depicting the constellation designed by the French painter Paul C?

"
1690,"7 is very convenient for the last stop of the line, and three stops to the Times Square, the Grand Central Station, and the other ends are famous flushing.I recommend you to try it.If you do not have a subway card, you can buy $ 3 a one -way one -way, and if you add $ 1 to the charging amount, you only pay $ 2.75.If you are traveling, you can also buy a 3 or 7 days pass.Even monthly passes, the MTA's subway and bus service can be used for free depending on the period of stay in New York.During that period, it is still very cost -effective and economical.

1691," When using the subway time zone, it is the same as the tonsil subway fee, and can be transferred to the bus from the bus and the bus to the subway.However, transfer is free.Once you get off the subway, it's not free to enter the subway, so please be careful if you are transferring.Thank you for your support!It was a great experience, but it was a great experience.It was very easy to rush and come out of the station.It is very centered on the ground./ Clean Station.If you take an escalator, it can cause dizziness for some people, so make sure that long escalators (if you don't ride an elevator) are okay.The only problem in the IS station is about train 7, which runs the station.It is also convenient and another charm for walking with children.View is free.Here you can spend all day and visit here four times. //34 -Hudson Yards is the New York City subway station in Manhattan West Side on the IRT flushing line.Opened on September 13, 2015, this station is the first subway expansion work that has been paid in the city in more than 60 years!The station is modern, clean, and unique!/It's one of the latest stations I've seen and I recommend it a lot.It would be nice if it was updated in real time.Other than that, the station close to work is really good!/It's one of my favorite subway stations in Manhattan!If you go down the long altitude, the lights are so bright that it feels like a space station!/This subway station is really beautiful from outside.But the interior is the same as other subway stations.Vassel, The SHED, The Shops, The Edge, and Skyline are here.there is.There is a huge steep escalator.It was like a slow roller coaster and I was waiting for death.It is not for those with high phobia, but I like the design of the subway station.It's never crowded or full like Times Square, but there are many people.This station is located near the train station dock, and I think that such a large terminal is not suitable for a single 7 train, so there should be more trains passing through this station.Overall, if you go up and down a few times, you'll get used to steep escalators.It is a new and clean station.The controlled environment is very helpful for cold and hot days.Since the opening of Hudson yards, this station has a convenient move to the store and park.The inclined elevator is the only thing in the system (as of 2020) because it is the most interesting.The new station means that the wanderer does not get rid of or that the famous NYC subway urine odor.All are new and clean.Because of the deep inside, there is a tremendous long escalator passage.Go back and look down and look down.I was surprised to see the mops on the train.Overall, this is one of the best stations in the city.In addition, it has a modern design.To get on the train, you have to take a long escalator, which is the only disadvantage.There is much more space to walk and much deeper underground.I hope that the escalator will be used continuously.And over time, the area is likely to be active due to new construction.This station is connected to the deep underground and can be moved to the long escalator.Because it is new, it has a minimalist appearance that contains very clean and breathable air.The lighting is also very good./ The best subway station!It's a bit unfair but still amazing because it's a new station and all the other stations are quite old.A wonderful station that is constantly being cleaned, and seriously, if you go there at any time, someone will clean it.West side and Chelsea have been greatly improved.Take 7 and go to Queens, Port Authority or Grand Central.There is always a delay, and the staff does not tell the cause of the delay.There are cameras, PA systems, and the Internet, but we cannot continue to provide information.Do not remove homeless people from the train to make it safer.And the guards of the window show their attitudes because you ask questions.This represents the huge cities of modern transportation hubs that represent the world's capital.If I can go to this station alone, it will be a welcome experience (except for some different stations).At this time, the facilities are clean, easy to pass and enjoy it.You can connect to all routes. "
1692," This station is a state -of -the -art station, and according to my experience, there is always a train waiting for departure.There is not so many people now.It is clear that there is a very large plan for the area, and the MTA ensures that it can accommodate the future crowds.Unlike the bathroom tiles, it looks very modern and clean because of the beautifully designed murals decoded on the wall.Do not misunderstand.There is nothing opposite to classical construction, but it feels like the entire bathroom tile installation work that has been in progress for decades is in a huge toilet.7, which ends here, is only hopeful of the crowds that will be flocked to the surrounding development area./ This is a new station (relatively) with modern buildings, but if you look closely, you can wear signs and maintenance defects (eg escalator ceiling)).

The upper mezzanine has a toilet, the lower mezzanine has a lot of space, and there is a display on the wall.As with expectations for future crowds, the platform level is very wide.The whole station is also bright.(The only reason for the four stars is that leaks have been reported around the station ... but it is expected to be because the station was built near the river.)The last station of the route .../Amazing subway station.This is a good way to go west.The Jarvis Center is on the corner and offers a breathtaking view of the highline.A must -see attraction.If you are in Grand Central or Time Square, take 7 here.I was a little surprised by the big escalator.It is interesting to ride a long and deep escalator.The depth is 109 feet.It is also interesting that the elevator in the station is also inclined.Please check if you are on your own.You can use the convention center and the new HUDSON YARDS area under construction.ㅋㅋㅋ It was fun to surf the subway by riding the trains 7 times from Hudson Yard 34.In fact, it's really a good breeze/Thanks to this new station, it's very close to the Megabus platform.There is also a new station, and the station premises are kept clean, and even many works of art are available.The escalator is quite long, but you can sit comfortably and ride comfortably.One of the most popular places is the Highline Park, which is currently extending to 34th Street. "
1694,"It provides a great view.Including straight.Wow!There is only one block away from the Jacob Javis Convention Center and Highline Park.The Hudson River and New Jersey's prospects are so beautiful.A must -visit place.I've been to the bus stop for the first time.I met MTA Chairman Andy byford.I went into the classic city bus.The classic bus had leather seats.I also went into a new two -car bus that adds a WiFi charger.They change the color in front of the city bus.There are dark blue, sky blue, yellow, and sky blue.I like a new MTA bus with two WiFi chargers like a snake.It is the best vehicle for the MTA bus.I want to go to another bus stop in the future.But there is no signal for the next train.There is no police officer who can help the platform ./34 Street-Hudson Yard Subway Station is one of the most future-oriented buildings in the Manhattan subway system in New York.So if you are going to Hudson Yard, take a train from Midtown to experience this wonderful ride and destination.

"
1746," The building of this building is really beautiful and fascinating.I am very happy to be the first destination for my trip to Manhattan.The station itself is very rich in NYC history and can be seen throughout the station.The ceiling paint is especially beautiful.Altho is a very old station for many years, but has a modern additional feature while keeping history vividly.It's one of my favorite stations as NYER, and it's also a place for a friend/family to visit!/Because I am a movie fan, it was a great experience to visit Grand Central Station.I often watched in movies and I really wanted to go.It is a wonderful building that catches the eye and the eye -catching wonderful architecture.no see.Be sure to check when you are in New York.Admission is free/is a wonderful station with many history inside.If it's the first time, look for a walking tour that knows the secrets of the building, such as the black spots of the ceiling, whispering halls, and mythological bars inside.The signboard is good and the smell of urine is rarely!A+/I lived in New York for many years, but it was actually a year ago that I first visited Grand Central.(It's weird?) I was surprised at so much beauty.Design, lighting, building, ceiling picture ... It was really fantastic and it is still.Take it wherever you go to your destination like a city trip.There are also trains on Line 4 and Line 5 for express, and free transfers are faster than local trains such as Line 6.Even if you stand under the beautiful constellation on the ceiling, you will find out what the main lobby is.While in New York, everyone should try to walk this beautiful building./ Well .... impressive.It is soft and clean and has a bathroom and a nice arched oyster.It must be completed.And Saturday/Sunday is a waste of time.MTA is a joke.??It's not a safe place…/A wonderful building that can be around.It's ashamed, but they agreed to put the Apple Store in it.It is worth seeing and there are various foods and drinks options.It was much more impressive than I thought!/Very well managed and preserved terminal.I'm in the movie.The ceiling has a constellation and lights drawn like stars.It is a large terminal.The glorious main hall, decorated with Tennessee's marble floor and Italian marble ticket office, is covered with an arched ceiling depicting the constellation designed by the French painter Paul C? Sar Helleu.When the commuters complained that the sky was upside down (it was drawn as if looking down from the top), it was insisted to be intentional (perhaps I don't want to admit the error)..The interior is so cool and there are many places to eat in the restaurant.The ceiling was probably my favorite part!/That details and plans went into this station.Don't just run around, but spend time to enjoy architecture and build.The overall structure is well and it is not bad to transfer with other trains.The memory of this station is that you have to get a LIRR ticket in order not to use the LIRR ticket after a month.I tried to deal with the recent news of the huge ticket gate, but again, it is closer to the systematic problem of NYC that has flowed into the MTA rather than the MTA's fault./ I had great expectations for the New York subway, but I used this transportation system.Is completely disaster.First of all, the train was frequently delayed, and when the next train would arrive, I waited for a long time at the platform without any information.The air conditioning of some trains was not noticeable because it was not present or too weak.On the hot summer day, the train was like a sauna, and by the time I arrived at my destination, my sweat was soaked.I have seen many times that rats wander around the track, and some stations have a terrible smell.The lack of cleanliness felt that it was unstable and not safe.As a tourist, I knew it was difficult to explore the system and often found that I was lost or riding a wrong train.It became more difficult to find a way because of the lack of clear signs and announcements.Frequent delays, overcrowded trains, lack of air conditioning, dirty stations, and confusing maps have been an unpleasant and stressful experience.I will not recommend this transportation system to anyone.Clean the station because there are many passengers on weekends and labor days.I'm very glad to see this station and it's fortunate to be stored .../The beautiful thing is that cleanliness, information services and security are all in your service, clarifying inquiries and modifying the path.Is bad and there's no way to improve it.The platform is small and not safe.Train 7 is relatively new, clean and much cleaner than other routes.The Central Terminal (GCT, Grand Central Station [N 2] or simply called Grand Central) is a commuter train terminal located in 42st Street in Manhattan Midtown, New York City and Park Avenue.Grand Central connects the northern part of New York to the southern part of the Harlem, Hudson, and New HAVEN routes of Metro-North Railroad.In addition, it is connected to the Long Island Railroad through the Grand Central Madison station, a 16-acre (65,000m2) rail terminal under the Metro-North station built from 2007 to 2023.The terminal is also connected to New York City.Grand Central? 42nd Street Ride the subway.The terminal is the second -largest train station in North America, following the New York Penn Station.Borjar design contains numerous works of art.Grand Central Terminal is one of the top 10 tourist attractions in the world.In 2018, 21.6 million visitors visited except for train and subway passengers.

I'm New York or Friends!There are many entrances and outlets, so you can find convenient exit in most destinations in the area.The construction is underway with minimal interruptions to improve the subway main entrance.

""Even though there are schedules and boards that are updated with ""real -time information"", they can be reliable as much as 8 times of magic.It must be managed/There is no way to pay with a decent path/Apple Pay compared to other stations in New York, and you need to buy a ticket card!It is one of the main stations that can ride the PATH train.Very busy but clearly displayed guidelines/worst train stations in New York.Credit cards for touch and high in the ticket gate, Apple Pay cannot be used, and vending vending vending cards can be purchased in the 1980s, and cash cannot be used.I tried to buy a ticket with a credit card, but it was a nightmare.It took 12 hours.Try to finally make a ticket issuing a ticket.It was really the worst experience./ New York is a very nice and clean subway station in New York.I have tried more than seven times on each computer, but I can't handle it.Others require accurate change.I gave up almost without any help, and I tried it last time just before using the Uber, and I could buy two travel cards without recharging.The same is true for WTC machines.It's the worst machine needed to board the train, but it doesn't work.This is a great location if you want to board the PATH train from Manhattan to New Jersey.Journal Square, in particular, is not only Jersey City but also the main location/transportation hub of New Jersey and New York City.I like how to board a special path metrocard.The fare is now $ 2.75 in the United States.Disagreement.It's a bit confusing to go around when you pass it for the first time, but after passing through the PATH stop, you will be able to go to a decent place where you can go elsewhere in the city.Most of the North Jersey can be easily accessible.Hoboken train seems to be a bit less crowded, but it's just the day I rode.The service is fine. There are good days and bad days. It is better than sitting on traffic and paying for parking fees and tolls. ""This overlap is a fascinating multi -layered subway station.Add the path line to see the tremendous flow of people from all autonomous districts and people from Hoboken and Journal Square.Unfortunately, one of the most crowded exits heading to the streets is currently under construction, so the entrance/exit is crowded and sometimes conflict with passengers who move in the opposite direction.So walk easily and carefully when you are here.In the summer when the entire basement turns into a furnace, you can arrive close to the desired departure time (the timetable is posted on the PATH homepage), so you don't have to be underground for too long, and you don't have to suffer in the heat..If you don't have a ticket, it may take time to buy, so assign an extra time.This station is directly connected to Manhattan Mall/JC Penny, so it is convenient for those who want to shopping.//It is excellent in access to Empire State Building to Empire State Building.Route 6 is very crowded, so avoid commute.Nevertheless, the train operates quite often.Use for more than 1 year.It is impossible to buy a ticket every time, and every time you miss the train./Train station to NJ PATH.That was my first impression of New York.

1789,"New York City Hall Subway Station.There's nothing special, and it's a good idea to get off here to cross the Brooklyn Bridge from Manhattan.My favorite train is the R142A subway with the JESSCIA advertisement.I hope that the MTA will record this fact and re -publish the original announcement in the Lexington Avenue Line, which started NYC and all human life in the city.As an African -American, it is worth $ 2.90 for subway fare, so pay the fee.Because it provides value.If you go to other states, there is no transportation.Or maybe I'm always looking at 777, or it's just lucky.I liked this place!It is easy to walk from Brooklyn to New York, and the subway can be easily reached nearby.The view is really cool!Everyone must take this walk!/It's a big train station for those who want to go to Brooklyn Bridge, but it's more suitable for locals who have to go to the shopping area.Either way, it's a train station that doesn't work more than moving from one place to another.It is recommended to take the tennis because the promenade is long.It is a street.For example, a group of elephants pass by to prove that it is reliable and not fraud.It was created before the existence of a car.You must remember that there is a bicycle path (respect it and the bike passes at full force).Even if the lock is visible, it cannot be left, a fine is imposed, and the lock is very likely to be lost the next day.It is easy to cross the bridge or take the subway to Manhattan.no see.There is a faded magnificence.If you stay on the subway, you can see when it will change from downtown to uptown.Do not be afraid of leaving all passengers.It is embarrassing that the bottom line is not so magnificent.It is functional but nothing special.It is very convenient to maintain a better sign for the exit and the beautiful tiles that have seen a better time (a few years ago).I took a taxi before, but the driver was lost in the wrong position.The subway saves our lives and taxis are very expensive.I want to go back to Manhattan later.It's much more convenient than Staton Island.It usually runs on time/I was in Brooklyn to see my sister, it was a great day.It was crowded with people, but it did not reduce my great experience.I recommend visiting this symbolic place and keeping it clean, and I believe it is forbidden to put a lock on the leg fence.Everything seems to be fine.Brooklyn's beautiful panoramic..It is recommended to walk in the direction of the Brooklyn Bridge downtown by the subway.It was built in 1909.It is natural without modern tools.It would have been adversity.Beautiful building.The interior is empty.Line 4 and Line 6 are running under it.They no longer build these buildings.This place is convenient to go anywhere.The World Trade is about 5-6 blocks from Chinatown and Little Italy./ The City Hall Loop, which was opened in 1104, was once a luxurious terminal station used by about 600 passengers a day.Passenger trips through this station have been suspended after 40 years due to the rapid increase in the New York population.Today you can visit the station only at a very specific time of a year.At one time, it was a popular spot where locals and travelers could see the complex designs of the past, but they were closed in the mid -20th century.In addition, all trains on Line 6 form the end of this place, and the direction is changed to the opposite direction.But what most people don't know is that if Line 6 continues to ride, the track passes through the old and abandoned city hall.It is very interesting but not much to see the lights of the train rarely shine the old platform, and the light upstairs is coming through the stairs that go up to the city hall.It's very fun to see, but it's not very good to take a picture./If you take train 6, which is the last station, keep boarding the train.why?You can meet beautiful and historical viewing.I think it was closed in the 20s.If you pass it, train 6 will appear again on the uptown platform.The new station is beautiful.I like the iron cable around the entrance of the city hall, but keep the interval in mind when getting on the train and getting off.The station is a bit bent./I highly recommend it to see the clean and old city hall stop after the train of Line 6 continued to ride around.It's just changing the direction, and you can get off at the station in the north direction.Climbing the stairs is full of noisy atmosphere.The park had a great crowd and performers who are doing all kinds of acts.The choices to go and the direction to go are somewhat overwhelming, but the stairs were the first step of the journey across the Brooklyn Bridge.If you are going to travel, please prepare.If the weather is good, there will be a lot of people who take a walk. "
1790," If you go back to the review you looked forward, this station has a lot of lines to go anywhere.Make sure you downloaded the app so you can see which train to take.I was going to the wrong road several times before I found the app!If you visit Brooklyn Bridge (1 minute walk), Wall Street or World Trade Center (10-15 minutes walk), the location is really convenient.And if you also visit the Grand Central Terminal, you can take a minimum of 15 minutes by riding the express train 4 or 5 times here.You can keep staying while returning, and you can get a glimpse of the beautiful and abandoned city hall.Many people seem to have done this without any consequences.But if I was caught, I read that the MTA could impose a fine of $ 50 or more.If you want to have a good tour, you can check the ticket at the New York Transportation Museum, which is usually difficult to get a ticket because the ticket is sold out quickly without a tour.This station is accessible to wheelchairs and provides mobile phone services and free Wi-Fi.There is also a departure sign that tells you when the train will come.If you stay in Line 6, which has been on the end, you can get a glimpse of the ruined city hall station.Travel!

1791,". Our guide was very well aware of the history of the area and had a passion for architecture.This was actually added to the tour.My only problem is that NYTM does not tell me in advance that audio equipment is used on the tour.(I'm not a deaf, but I have a little bit of difficulty in the sound of a particular type. There was a lot more like a tour.). "

If you want to go to Kabuki -cho, you can find a shop without information. Find a shop with a shop.There are many men and foreigners recruiting guests on the side of the road.It is better not to go.I've done it many times.This time it was okay, but I don't know when it will happen.So I suggest not to believe in a man who drives guests on the side of the road.Even if I did before, I have succeeded many times in a way of gathering guests on the side of the road.But today I was cheated by 24,500 yen because I gathered guests on the roadside. The degree of technique and intimidation still surprised me.Everyone knows that the underground world of Japan is legal and the police will not interfere.There are advantages and disadvantages, but honestly, I hope it will be clearly translated so that Japanese people can understand.This time, the price is just a little cheaper than others.I am a customer who can compare the price.If the price is much lower than the normal price, you will understand that there is a problem.I can no longer say because I know that Japanese people are very smart.This time, I was recruiting guests from the roadside, and the person who recruited guests from the side first told me what I needed, and asked me about the regulations, and there was no regulation at all.Before I came to Kabuki -cho, I knew that there were a lot of regulations in the Japanese world, and I was told that people who did not keep them were cut off.So I always ask first and check many times so that everything is clear.I took me to the hotel and paid for it.The room was charged 13,000 yen first and the hotel fee was 1,500 yen.He told me to check it again and down several times from downstairs.The hotel has opened a new room.There was no big problem at the counter and it was very smooth.In the room, he told me to call the girl and call the girl before he claimed 13,000 yen.Of course, he confirmed that the total price is 14,500 yen and the hotel is 1,500.He charged 13,000 yen and called the woman, and she arrived in less than five minutes.As soon as I put down the bag outside the door to go to the bathroom, she came in and asked where.The person who introduced me downstairs also knew the terrain of the hotel, and as soon as I entered the hotel, he introduced the overall layout of the hotel.When I went to the bathroom and entered the room, she asked me to take a shower first, and my stuff was outside, but I asked if I would like to take a shower together.The girl refused.I respected the opinions of the girls and went to take a shower alone.I took a shower quickly because the things would be stolen, and the girl said that it couldn't be for me.He told me to wear clothes and asked what kind of service he wanted., I said in advance, so I don't have to claim anymore.The cheapest plan for women was 30,000 won, which is more expensive.The money he gave to the introduction was not counted at all. The person was too high. The salary was so high that he didn't leave it anyway.It is possible to cancel.I pointed my body and said, ""I took off my clothes. How do you cancel?""Anyway, I asked a few times and I couldn't cancel it for free.The cancellation fee is at least 10,000 yen.Refuses to wear clothes.The lowest plan is massaged for 30,000 yen.In the end, he canceled without saying anything and refused to use money.Please let me go anyway.Eventually, he originally used an additional 10,000 yen for 14,500 yen, and the girl left without anything.If you are going to the custom shop, you can go to the ""Information Store"" to accept it even if you cancel it after considering.But the risk of recommending guests on the side of the road is very high.The price of ""drink and putting"" is not very high, and it does not threaten to take clothes or things.Personally, whether or not to report it to the police, it is your problem that Japanese police gangsters are allowed, customized shops are allowed, and custom stores and gangs are not allowed to say that there is a problem.There is a problem if a gang is a problem.If there is a problem, there will be no evidence, otherwise the gangsters of the world will be protected.Keep looking for someone to retaliate.Anyway, it's all legal.The whole Japanese society is not trying to solve the problem.The environment is cleaner and less garbage. If you go deep into Japan, you will understand. You haven't experienced this pain, so if you see this, I know you want to laugh at it.There is nothing I can do and I'm helpless.If you meet me someday, you will understand.If you want something else rather than ""drinking and attaching the title,"" go to the milk case office.I can't win.Please keep these illegal and non -shoppers from surviving ~~ Please make Japan better in this field.Why are there more more ""foreign"" beggars in Japan's streets?His present may be our future.Oh, but I don't want to swear, but I will surely be retaliated.I dare to say that you deceived many foreigners and they all paid normally. Why do I put off so much?If everyone wants to open your wounds, if everyone is so compromised and afraid of shame, will there be more people who are deceived??

When I came to Tokyo and Chiba, Honhachi was a low place and no special feeling.But it's amazing to the recent development.There are also a lot of negotiation mansions, so many shopping malls, home appliance stores, and sports gymnasium have been built.Now I feel that Honhachi is a convenient station in a very great place.It was used to transfer from Shinjuku Line to Sobu Line.The speed of the small line does not stop, but it is crowded with sharing.There is also a station building, so I think you can do various shopping.It can be transferred to Doei Shinjuku Line, so there is a shopping center on the way.!

2750," Anyway, Nico is far away.The train in the direction is a significant dangerous area where the main/street smoking criminals are significant.This station is reminiscent of the Shinkansen station platform because the distance between the platform door and the train is very far compared to the general station (except the Shinkansen).I think this is because the express/quasi -class train passes fast.For those who want to see a train running fast at low cost, it is a fun station.In addition, five -quotes of trains (cucumbers) stops (only morning and night), so be careful when the train comes.The surrounding area is the same as the calm mansions, and there is a Tokyu Store in front of the Miyama Egu Government Office in the walking volume, in addition to the castle Sii and Inagaya in front of the station.Tips Ness Sports Clubs and Ukke Mouries are popular leisure facilities.There are many parks around Miyama Ehira Station.Miyama Daeda Park, Miyama Daida 2 Park, Miyama Dada 3rd Park, which is easy to go for a walk or play a child.Miyama Egu -gu station close station.There is a Tokyu Store in front of the ticket gate./ The north exit is suddenly a hill and is on the main road.Instead, the chain's supermarket dances.It is known that the boss lives a lot.I think it's hard to get off because there's a lot of emergency foods that I don't see in the home door so that I can open the middle of the middle.Naruzo Ishi, bank, Daiso, home center, convenience store, lunch shop, flower shop, etc., and also a very easy station.The old days were better, but it's pretty good now./There is no escalator, but there is an up and down elevator..The toilet is a bit spacious./ I feel especially especially in recent years.

3218," TokyuIn addition to the line, the JR is clean and the air conditioner is comfortable.Hundreds of meters from high -rise mansions, there was a great Boro apartment that could not be Sendai, and it was attacked by a strange sense.That period is a warrior course.The station building Tokyu Square is equipped with small but faithful shops such as daily goods, clothes, and restaurants in groceries.Since it is a bus society, you can use the bus to enjoy some trips.The commuter rush in the morning and evening becomes a crowd of people who can't do anything, but the holiday can be a bit relaxed.On the Tokyu Line, it was quite convenient by the board of trilogy, such as the forest park, Hanno, Hatogaya, and Nishita Kashima Hirahe.It was a village with nothing. "
3219," And as others pointed out more, it is essentially false to say that the station is not the same station or transfer station.Advertising.You have to walk for at least 10 minutes between the station.At that point, if you are on the other side of the desired line, it's a good idea to just take another train.It is also a problem if you came here for business purposes and choosing a commuting hotel. "
3220,"I passed through the paid JR gate, and after walking and walking, I had to go out of the gate to go to the line instead of JR.Because of the same station, I thought that the card would be settled because of an error in the card.I literally charged only the charges!For walking!And I followed the sign and I don't know what happened, but if you look at my Google map location, you seem to have sent me to a huge circle ??This station is a complete fraud./jr and Tokyu's intersection.It's a little far away, a passage of contact, but walks.Keep walking through the transfer, transfer, and southern route platform to climb the staircase escalator and arrive."
3221," is a Musashi KOSGI, I think that the fundamental reform and modification of the line is needed.There is also a caffper problem on the southern line, but it may occur that can cause people to go home at the moment.The layout is wise :/jr and a Tokyu line are on board.It is always the top of the village I want to live.Yokohama, Shibuya, and Meguro are difficult to replace.In typhoon 19, it was swept away by unexpected disasters.It was submerged with water flooding.It seemed to be predicted on the hazard map for the first time./I went twice this year, but both of them were definitely lost in the station. "
3222,There is no excellent access in the metropolitan area. 
3223,"Convenient and easy -to -live street NO.1??/As you write down, the native line and Tokyu are no longer a different station on the Yokosuka Line (Shonan Shinjuku Line). "
3224,. I was surprised that it was the first use of 
3225,", but if you think it is such a station (if you know), I don't think it's inconvenient to transfer.【Caution】 It's a very odor station "
3226,"I only knew it, but I can't understand why JR has granted it.The grooves of Sun -Shonan Shinjuku Line are quite separated from other lines, which takes time to transfer.In addition, the number of grooves is not too small for the number of users, and on weekday morning, the home regulation of the home is everyday.I can't keep it. "
3227," I feel that it's a regret that is not maintained for transportation networks for tower mansions and redevelopment.Transit movements are also very crowded, so it's a good idea to take a leisure and transfer.Air conditioning is more effective than home waiting room (laughs).The Tokyu Toyoko Line is not good to connect to the ticket gate, so it can be around for waste.I wonder if the connection between JR and Silver is not kind at other stations./Tokyu line is clean anyway.Commercial facility access is also outstanding.However, the home is narrow, so the escalator cannot receive one up and down.In addition, the access to the south exit of JR is very bad.This may not be possible, but…/If you cross the river, there are already a lot of strange workers, or because you have an excessive mortgage or stress with work, and the rush time zone is a bloody atmosphere.Unmanned, I am the center of the world. "
3228,"The train becomes very peaceful after getting off./The main terminal is developing.Anyway, it was awkward with a late announcement.I was surprised!/I knew that, so I moved to me.The transfer of congestion is very dangerous.The residents of the native ship users, the Toku Line user, the residents of the safe -free course, are all very bad, so it is better not to use it as much as possible when transferring on the side of the province.There were people who were reverse or running around, so they seemed to be injured.I usually use other equivalent stations, but because it is not so severe, it may be a land pattern.It is more than honesty.Is it convenient when using the Sotetsu Line ?/ The Tokyu Line is Nakame -gu, it's easy to come out in Shibuya.Mix. "
3229,"/Only the surface is getting clean, but it smells like sewage around the stairs.There are many users in Kanagawa, who are deliberately bumped into and followed with elbows.Kanagawa Hyunmin and Kawasaki are condensed./J. The position of the train may not be displayed on the platform of the train, depending on the seat location of the train.I like Tokyo Line.It takes 10 minutes to commute to the Toku Line on the JR line.only…The home and the native line, such as the Yokosuka Line, are too far.It may be fast to use each thorns and Shinkawasaki in the neighborhood.The fare will increase as you come out once, and the fare will increase.In addition, it is recommended to check for each line of transit, as it requires 8 minutes and 5 minutes in a hurry, because the nymph line and the Yokosuka line (or Sotetsu direct line) and the standard for 5 minutes are in a hurry.Since April 2022, home doors have been installed in Nanfan Line Home.JR's Ekinaka has only toilets other than the event space, but on the Yokosuka Line and the Tokyu Line, there is no difference from Ekina Ka, and the store is faithful.In addition, there will be a passage with the Toyoko Line at the exit of the Yokosuka Line (2023).?/Why is it so inconvenient here ... "
3230,.The popular café shop elsewhere will be closed in Musashi Courses ... 
3231,"The station was cold, the response was suitable and sad.If you tighten it quickly, please say that it will respond with a station or a valley next to the ticket ticket.In addition, it is a refund. "
3232,"There are many shops below and nearby./jr Yokosuka Line Musa City Course Station to Tokyu Musa City Course Station is a very long walk.I felt like walking about 1km.So what I want to say is that it is a big station.You can also see the Shinkansen on the JR Yokosuka Line platform.Tokyu Toyoko Line, Tokyu Meguro Line, JR Southern Line, JR Yokosuka Line, Superview Odorico, and Narita Express are suitable for transfers.In addition, the noisy voice is a Musashi course, the announcement is very good and does not suffer from hearing.The trains are also very good, and Kiki ~ Loar or noisy Otto is about once or twice.Very great Musashi Kosugi!Therefore, the surrounding area always smells like cigarettes. "
3233," bus terminal is 4 places at the north entrance, east entrance, east entrance (bus stop only), and Yokosuka exit.You can use it at any time.I think it's hard to move and it's easy to wander because it's divided.The power and free WiFi are equipped with few quiet places."
3234," I have a lot of shops, but I want to have a shop!!! "
3235," It was good to not move.I really regret .../When I try to use an escalator when heading from Tokyu to Nanhu Line, it sometimes smells like a strong raw garbage.The collection site is nearby, but I hope you will take some measures.So far, it was the same form in the upper and lower line, so the morning and evening was overflowing with people.Since it has become a form of the upper and lower line, I think that the congestion of the groove has been resolved.Therefore, it is difficult to arrive from the street on the route of the purpose. "
3236,"In recent years, Tawa and Bay and large commercial facilities have become sophisticated and convenient.There are a lot of restaurants around the station, but I didn't see the shops very much."

3239,"?Although there was a castle, the only Osgi Tower Place in front of the station was the street of a worker if it was far from ""cool"" in the station where there was some atmosphere of Shimomachi.Since it was expected to improve the convenience of opening the Yokosuka Line, a large -scale redevelopment of high -rise apartments in the surrounding factory ruins has been carried out, and it has become around the current Musashi course.According to the fact that the processing ability of the party was greatly lacking, the abnormal situation that the abnormal situation was stated that hundreds of thousands of times to pass the statement, but the improvement has been continued, and it is now solved.The number of passengers in 1995 was 60,000 people in 1995, which was almost 120,000 of the ships in 2020, which was about 120,000 units in 2020. "
3240," tower mansion, the elevator takes time until the rabbit arrives at the groove of Kado.The train is a wedding...So even though the Oita was clean, it was unfortunate that it was not realistic to live around this station.The JR's main ticket gate was respected by the lost material, but it was not a Yokohama branch. "
3241," Anyway, this station is very crowded.It is difficult to walk quite up and down when transferring.If you think about the convenience of the popular number 1 that you want to live easily, I think it's convincing. "
3242,"If you don't feel frustrated, it's not a countryside.I think it's a balanced distance. "
3243," It's just convenient and good, but it's easy to get a pain here.I felt a quiet station with a feeling, but I think that the tower mansion is well established nearby and the vicinity of the station has been developed accordingly.If the waiting time in this home is long, the total travel time does not change even in the diesel of Kawasaki "
3244,"3.Since it is in the 3rd side of the ejaculation (Shosin, Utsu, Shosin, Takasaki, Sobu Fast), the destination is a merit, but if you are not familiar with the train or more than you go to your destination (such as child care, etc.),The disadvantage is that you can go in the direction. "
3245,"4. The merit of the transfer at Tokyo Station is the Marunouchi Line and the Yamanote Line and Keihin Tohoku Line.On the contrary, if you try to use the station as much as possible, it's the farthest.If you want to delay a little bit of Rush Hour, you will be overflowing.Considering the safety surface, it was good to broaden it or divide the layer by downward line.Be careful as strollers and wheelchairs are really dangerous.And it takes about 7 to 10 minutes to transfer to southern lines and Toku..Anyone who says that there is no such distance for a favorite person who says that the station is crowded or not entering a nursery, it is good to live in the suburbs that take more than an hour from the city center for convenience and exchange.The transfer of Shonan Shinjuku Line? Nanfan Line) takes 10 minutes no matter how slowly quotes, so if you do not have enough time, you will be wings that will be transferred if you can't afford it.In addition, the liaison passage is a little narrow, and after the difference in transportation between the nanfire and the Yokosuka line. "
3246," seems to have a home expansion design (2022), so I hope you will start quickly... "
3247," You can walk the station on the nanfire line, but you will walk for more than 5 minutes.It is better to go to the Yokosuka Line after shopping at the Newdays in the Phase of the Nanfan Line, because there is no canteen. "
3248,"Convenience is convenient.All trains, including the express, stop.Uh, it is a high convenience station.Tokyu Toyoko Line, Meguro Line, JR Naval Line, Yokosuka Line can be arrived in Shonan Shinjuku Line and Yokohama in the province without transfers.The difficulty is Tokyu, the Yokosuka Line is far from the groove of the nanfather.It takes about 10 minutes to go through the home of the Nanbu.It is fast to walk from the south exit and the east exit.And I'm happy to be able to do a shop near the opening of the Yokosuka Line, but around the station, Grande Tree, Larateras, Toku Square and the usual shopping are faithful.If you like it, it's faster to walk to Muka Wara Station than to change it honestly.Tokyu is also on board Toyoko Line and Megu.In the rumor, you can hear that the Shinkansen, which is passing by the side of the station, is also stopped."

3250," Why don't you put a moving report??In the design stage, east of JR should be ordered in consideration of more efficiency and convenience. "
3251," is a waste.When you get off at the station, you can see only Tawa and rich in green.It's a good place to be convenient/livable because access is good, but because of this role, Yokosuka Line is now a regular of the congestion rate!(4th, 191% 2016) It takes more time to take more time, where all the users in the west are all closed!Besides, the paving of NEX or Shinjuku Line is so preferential to pass!Wherever you go, it's fast. "
3252," It takes 5 minutes to transfer to the Yokosuka Line.The congestion of the JR ticket gate, as well as the transfer from the Yokosuka line to the Toku Line, is comparable to the scrambling of Shibuya.You must walk six trains on the southern lines.In the morning and evening rush, Jackie Chen's action.I want to hang it over time.I'd rather expect a succession with the Shinkansen.// The Home is installed in the Shonan Shinjuku Line, so it is convenient to transfer with the Nanfan Line ~ It's just too far!

3254," and I often talk about the murderous congestion of the morning rush, but I don't know because I'm not a local.It is directly connected to it.I felt that the speed of the escalator from the nanfather home to the ticket gate was very fast.I think it is the fastest Kanto!Is this specification because there are many users?When you get off the escalator, your body is thrown forward because it is momentum.It will be dangerous for the elderly.Let's borrow a skin force here!Let's bypass Tokyu's Musagosugi Station and JR Yokosuka Line!The direction is upside down, so the first car becomes the direction of Yokohama and is equipped with the basics of the JR.JR East Japan is all No. 1 for Osaka.The center line is in the opposite direction to enter the Ohi factory.In addition, JR's driver is a lactin because it is good to wait.Please cooperate because Sotetsu is doing strong work?The Saikyo line is a treasure trove, be careful!Since Shibuya Station is 5 stories below the basement of Hikarie, it may be as convenient as the ground on the ground, but it is said to be 11/30.If you are in Kawago, you can go directly to the Dobu Dodo Line to the Dobu Dodo Line.But if you think about transportation costs, Tokyu is absolutely cheap.It is in the place where you think. "
3255,", even if there is a walking report now, it is safe to see for 5 to 10 minutes in the transfer.I walk to where it is not. "
3256," is also the eighth place after Shinjuku Station, Ike Bukuro Station, Yokohama Station, Shibuya Station, Osaki Station, and Ebisu Station in the station of Shonan Shinjuku Line.There are many high -rise apartments around N, so it is expected to flourish more and more.However, if you want to change the route (destination) or platform you want to use, the station of the first apostle that is not shaer.Walk.People who walk every day may be exercise than attending central sports in front of the station!?/Significant, Musashi course.I think it's a composition to go to Tokyo by changing the native line to the Toyoko line or Yokosuka line, but it is also saturated even if you live in Osugi.Groove's entry is not a passenger from Futago Tama, and is it every thorn?Hidden attractions can be used with. "
3257," There are udon shops, bagel shops, convenience stores, supermarkets, and formats on the site.The transfer was comfortable, but after the redevelopment, it took time to take time.It is.The transfer from Nanbu to Shonan Shinjuku Line or Yokosuka Line takes a lot of time, so it is time!Transfer to Yokosuka Line "
3258," even if you can't help it with a narrow groove in the home of Kawasaki, but if you can use an unused escalator in Yokohama, I think you can relieve the congestion around the stairs."
3259," is the fastest station in Tokyo Station, so it is inevitable that many users are inevitable.there is.Since it is not possible to ride in the conventional home (Sinagawa, Shinjuku), the library of the station building is also faithful and late.You can also go to Yokohama, Kawago, and Ishigami Park with Tokyo downtown and Toyoko Line.At least I think it's better than Kichi George.There are too many people who have distorted personality.It is also good to be able to take time at the window.It was quite crowded.In addition, when it is only your turn, it is said that please wait.Finally, when the replacement is over, I will give you a ticket to Narita Express.Come and scary.It may be good for women or children to be careful.Nanfish, Tokyu is far.Because the groove is curve, the train and the groove are empty.Note that you are on and off.The commuting time is severe.Unlike, it may be a huge time loss just by entering the building, so it may be good for the family, but there will be no merit to live with a single body.The real celebrity is also sold well here and is narrow compared to the Western celebrity town.It seems to be a celebrity even if I live here because I live in ancient times, rather than the ""high building"" called Takahata floating in the hidden spots. ""As a result, the transit of the Musashi course is quite depressed. "

Hiyoshi's own land was a slope.It's because it's because it's not planned properly.Since the station is used continuously, there is no space in the reversal, such as commuting in the morning, so there is no sidewalk, and the pedestrians, buses, taxis, and regular cars are distracted, and you can see the same wild scenes of the time slipped before the old days..Without a taxi rotary, there is a surprisingly long procession of a taxi waiting day on the day and late nights and late nights.The stairs going down to the groove are quite close to Tsunashima (especially the Meguro line is not enough to reach the train), and the groove is crowded to the center every morning.I think there's no idea that the fuck of the route on the Scascs Cine downhome is somewhat.I would like to say that it is not the case to sell a high groceries by making a department store in front of the station.I lived here and not originally lived in a city in Tokyo, but I was honestly surprised by the overwhelming rural feeling.It is a level that people who live in Hiyoshi will be deceived by documentary or brainwashing in many ways.This is uncomfortable, prices are high or understanding.Is it because it is the birthplace of the Dokyu train because it's a semi -underground station?There are many restaurants and popular shops around the station.Since Megu is connected to the North and South Lines, access is good to the northern Saitama, such as Naguro Naguro Naguro Naguro Nagatacho or Gorakuen, Prince and Urawa, and Takashimada.(There's also a green line, but I don't think it's a good thing about access, because all the warriors in the north of the center are not enough in Yokohama.)

"
3461," Nakano Station has a significant increase in the number of races and downs because of the headquarters of universities and large corporations.I think it's easy for families to live alone because they are good for security.I am neglected./The access to various places is good!Because of this, we are looking forward to future development!In recent years, clean at once!But too, ""Sun Plaza""!If you get off at the station, there are many shops.there is.The latter is famous for animation/cartoon dolls and tool collections/shops.In this area, there is a shopping alley Yokocho, which has many individual stores that sell products at reasonable prices.This area is also famous for its brand vintage watches and watches such as Rolex, Wiblo, Panerai and Patek Philip.One of the most famous shops is Jack Road.It is a centralized location where you can buy more detailed/old cartoons, old toys, collectors, and famous watches.The commuter return is ome with Ome from Tachikawa Station and more transfer at Nakano Station.Because there is no staircase in the middle of the home, it is very inconvenient to walk from home to the north direction especially with the transit of the return (to go to the north exit of the final arrival station).I was surprised at bad.Besides, because it is not a bad attitude alone, "
3462," is a lifeline, so whatever you tell the passenger, no matter what you do, you can benefit from the guests, and the structure of making money is scary.Will not go for reason for that reason? "

3520," The toilet was clean because it had a lot of number.So it's crowded.Express or each stop can be regretted and the same method is too incompetent.The JR and the Seybians stop here.If you know the way inside, you can move from point A to branch B without problems.Otherwise, open your eyes wisely because there are plenty of signs that will help you find the way.There is a toilet in the station, so it is always convenient./ The station is always crowded with students and office workers.On Friday night, you can see a lot of college students who are drunk at a nearby university.There are many good restaurants around you, so be sure to stop by!/Rotary is very crowded.Because there are many bars, it is convenient to take time near the station./Seibu Shinjuku Station is connected because it is congested/[reverse information] "

3524," because I always use the country's station, maybe I have been taken for granted in Tokyo, but isn't this an attitude? "
3525,"Naturally, it is not to say.I just want you to answer the question. "
3526, I think it's a good idea to educate again.It is clearly not suitable for those with bad legs. 
3527," people living in Tokyo often go to Tokyo to eat Myanmar food.It is very difficult to move to those who are many and uncomfortable.This is the reason for the small number of elevators or escalators.In addition, the elevator is also on the edge of the platform, and for those who take time to move, they live tremendously and become sweaty.On rainy days, it slides to roll.I wrote the questionnaire that is good to be fixed quickly?! But it hasn't changed for decades.It was good to change steadily in the Showa…If I changed since I was young, the number of escalators and elevators increased.The day before, I was walking right, but some people have been forced to hit.I want you to improve it somehow./jr Yamanote, Seibu Shinjuku Cuseon and Tokyo Metro Jay Line are usually many users."
3528,"There's a shop, so it's a favorite street because you don't have any food for shopping.Shouldn't you speak patiently if you have a question as a foreigner?Why is your attitude a bad teaching?Do you say Japan is a country of service terrestrial?Is this this?I hate hitting.Is it really bad ??In the ticket gate of the JR succession, if you are waiting for the previous person's response, the station inside you noticed and responded with me.There is only thanksgiving ??/JR (Yamanote), Sachee (Seibu Shinjuku Line), Subway (Ceramic Lee), and the three typical lines of three -system lines are convenient.However, it is inserted in the second downtown street called Shinjuku and Ike Bukuro, and it seems to be in a structure that is hard to develop because it is too subtle from either side.Similar examples include Harajuku, which is caught in Shinjuku and Shibuya, but this will be more difficult.Anyway, since the population of Japan has decreased, any distance is in a decaying fate.In the case of external sessions, it is not No. 8, but No. 11.It is a shop where you buy it.There are a lot of variations in car pickles, but there are many things that are sold out, and I was sorry.I hope that the popular products are not sold out.

3534," The stairs in the center of the home are Seibu Shinjuku Line transfer.not.Let's be careful.The next melody is the theme song of the first series of the popular animation `` Cheolwan Atom '', which is the president of Takadanova, where Takadanova, the president of Takadanova, is the minister,Scientificity ”was realized from the settings that this was in Takadanova.In 1927 (Showa 2 years), it was also the starting point of the Shinjuku Line.The home number is guided by 3 to 5 lines on the JR line.Home doors were also used in all homes until March 2021 (3 years).All vehicles need to be reserved, and 500 yen of express passes to Honkawaoe Station. "
3535," I felt that the heat lined with the express system and the stops appeared in home, but I felt that it was not the basis of the troubles.Since it is good in two types of each stop and an honorary train like the Meitetsu Nago Beauty, the source of chaos will not disappear unless the station is divided on each train!There are also plurality of entrances, and it is good to be able to distribute people at the time of entering.It is coldly treated as around 18 o'clock.I saw it again, but I didn't spend time.It was just fast to listen because it was not crowded at judging whether to receive transfer transport.I wrote other stations, but I would like to hold on to the young reverse of Seibu Shinjuku Sun.Attitude is a horizontal pattern./ Now there are few escalators and destination signs.Because of these many stations, I felt a lot of cheap shops nearby.There is no inconvenience, but it was not thought of the same station by stopping at the exit.Do you need a rescue review?/JR's home is narrow, but the downward groove of Seibu Shinjuku Line is too narrow.//I do not use it by using less than by using it.

"
3537,"There seems to be a story that you can live in English characters.It's a very easy to use station.And, in a crowded place with a salaryman, a tavern or ramen shop is a familiar station.The ramen shop is a little lower than near the station, so it is better to find a place that is located in the distance than to find nearby.It is convenient to transfer here. "
3538," The train is Honkawa Goeo, and the friendly side is 10 minutes intervals.It is also convenient because there are bakery and star bars in Seibu ticket gate.There are a few benches and the toilets are not dirty.I think it's an easy station. "

3540," You are a high school student, but you can transfer it in one minute.The express train of Seibu Shinjuku Line is also increasing, so the waiting time is also available.Since the toilet is currently in number, it is a bit uncomfortable or it will be more comfortable if it is completed.Since it is a transit station between Sey and Metro, it is crowded anyway.I'm using Yamanote Line, but the groove is narrow anyway, and it is good to be able to move when it is off.Passengers heading to the station exit (lower level) and passengers heading to Seibu transfer (upper class) are struggling.Even near the JR ticket gate on the first floor, passengers heading to the ticket gate and passengers from Seibu are bumped and gently proceed.Is it relieved because the toilet is moderate?I had a buckwheat shop, but I was sorry for the construction.How many times did you use it in the six years of the university age?And alumni still use 1 ~ capital a year.

3542, This is a relatively clean impression compared to other Yamanote lines.Didn't you have internal training?'
3543," What is it?I'm listening because I don't know.Using Caracon (reverse), is the service regulations okay?/Are you always using it??The service of the facility and staff is great.However, the Rush City's response is insufficient.Anyway, it is not strange to have an accident in the sense of lack of employees and securing safety.There are security guards, but at least, the time zone is a part -time job, a temporary staff, shouldn't it be completed?This is something that can be said in the station, but if you think from the perspective of lifesaving and customer, I think it should be considered more seriously.There are also physical disabilities and blind customers, so you can do it as a few of the deputy and the station.I think it's late, but I think it's late.There are a lot of time to go to work and work, especially in people.There is a mural that depicts his work including his work.It can remind you of the memory of an intersection of an intersection.I felt that I was a great person. "
3544," Thank you very much, thank you.It is not a gentle station because it requires stairs without any route.There is also the only elevator, but it will be difficult because it is in the middle of Rotary, so it will be difficult.The rush to Tama in the morning and evening is great. "

3556," Toy Tosai (easy to go to Disney, Furniture Lajaka, Tokyo Station), Seibu Shinjuku LineIt's easy to go), and there are three routes called Yamanote Line (easy to go anywhere), so convenient places that can be distinguished from onoffs are also attractive.It is an attractive city with a fascinating city.There are many people.In the morning, the JR and the Seyi Lines are linked in front of Takadanova Station, especially in the morning, and there are various shops and restaurants in the reversal, but also the Big Box.Takadanovaba is also an office street. Anyway, the groove is so narrow that it is very crowded.It's good because there are many boarding routes.There are Starbucks, Kobeya (Bread), Saki Jogen (Schumai), QB House (1000 yen cut), and Tomony (kiosk).Kobeya sells the remaining bread at night at night, so it's sometimes used to go back to the company.The transfer is fast and convenient because it is connected within the station of the JR.It is convenient because there is also a sturber and a tomony in the station.There are not many shops or services in the station itself.It is often full of Waseda college students.It is well managed and functional as a general Japanese style.So please do it again from the bottom.

As soon as you enter the ticket, there is an automatic vending machine or ATM.It is convenient because there is a vending machine in the center of the home.There are also a few benches at intervals.The groove itself is over 100m because the ceramic line itself has a large number of vehicles.There are two toilets in the ticket gate, so this is also very convenient.It takes about 10 minutes to go to the opposite groove. "
3559," ※ Waseda University near Nakano is convenient because it is directly related to the ticket gate.There is also an elevator on the ground at exit 3.About 70,000 people use it.As mentioned earlier, students and students are also very used because they have a lot of students or graduate students who go to Waseda University.In addition, Hachiman Shrine and Toyama Park, the Hachiman Shrine, are also convenient.Students and teachers at Waseda University use this station more and more.Thanks to this station, it is very easy to come to college.The station is very modern and has all the facilities.Many people use this station every day./It is the station of the Tokyo Metro Zay Line./ In March 2019, there was an elevator direct inquiry to contact the ground, in the home of Nakano.Because the groove is long, it is necessary to move a little, but this is the exit of the elevator, which could be done on both sides of Nishihu Navashi and Nakano.If you want to use the elevator in Nakihu Navashi, take the 10th bilateral and come out of the exit of Waseda University, but the morning and evening is a very crowded vehicle.There is a dog.

3564," A lot of Izakaya and cafes are eaves, and I enjoy the night walking of the night. "
3565,"It is a area that is loved by people.There are a lot of recent TV dramas, Kobo -chan statues, and subcultural systems.There are many shrines and religious facilities and many stylish shops.In order to greet that side, there is a Akagi Shrine (in the Akagiyama of Gunma Prefecture)! "
3566," So it's called beef!According to the origin of the name of the N 'Furniture Lajaka', according to the `` Edo Myeongdo -Kwon Kwon '' (7 years of Tenpo), there is a woman of Takada Hall Hachiman on the right side of this slope.Even though I played, the sound of Kagura of Wakamiya Hachiman is said to have been heard by this slope!When the kiln was heavy and could not go up this slope, it was easy to go up when playing Kagura, so it was written that it was named ""Furniture Lajaka"" than this!"
3567,".I am deciding to go back from the Zayun Furniture Lajaka Station.The Gagurazaka of the station name is exactly far south than here, but because of the station, it is also called furniture Lajaka.There are many stylish shops and companies along Waseda Street.The residential area spreads inside.It is a little different from the city center./It is the underground station of Toy Zay.The name of the furniture Lajaka seems to have been snow removal, and it was called ""Furniture Lajaka because the kiln was heavy and could not go up this slope, but when I played the game, I could go up comfortably.""When you enter the back alley, you can see the era of quiet and flourishing floral, luxury fairy, and Obokje.Nihonbashi Station…/It is Kagura Zaka Station in Tokyo Metro Toy Zay.There are only famous furniture Lajaka, and users think they are many stations in the ride of Ilno.There is also a Rajaka Station on the Dobeoe Oedo Line, but it is not connected in the basement, so it is necessary to walk on the ground once.Ceramics are passing directly below the furniture Lazaka, so use the Toga Line when you come to sightseeing.The toilet is near the exit of each side and is convenient.It is convenient because there are vending vending vending all over the home.There are many benches.The station user has a lot of office workers on weekdays and a lot of tourists on holidays.I don't think it's crowded up there.Please note that the home layer is divided by the side, so be careful because the Nakano will be comforted.There is La Zaka, Uehigome Furniture of Oe -do Line nearby. "
3568," It is a clean station..In addition, there was an Akagi Shrine (in Akagiyama, Gunma Prefecture) in order to live in the old days of beef from Gunma.So, you go with beef.The name furniture Lajakara was a very sound because there was a geisha who was ringing a musical instrument called furniture near the Edo era.Even now, in furniture Lazaka, the music of the stylish string is always flowing.It is also concerned about the lighting of the streets, so it is a stylish street just by walking.This land, which is still flourishing because of its history and traditions, is amazing! "
3569,"kagurazaka, surprisingly, was alredy proprouses Before the EDO period.In the Past, An Influential Man named Ushigome from Gunma Prefecture Moved to this Area, and the akagi shrine (named after mt.

3570," There is also a use of Tokyo Metro Toga Lee Seon Station located in Yaraecho, Shinjuku -gu, Tokyo.There is a shopping mall from the exit of the furniture to JR.About 400 meters south of Dang Station, there is a Ushi Gome Furniture Lazaka Station in Dowi Oedo Line.Street with.At 1A entrance near Idabashi, there are convenience stores 'Family Mart' and 'Lawson' nearby.It is the only two -story structure of the only fasting groove in the first line.In the direction of the progress, line 2 (towards Nakano) is the door on the right side, the first line (towards Nashu Nabashi), the door on the left is opened.The same is true of Nezu and Machiya Station. "
3571," It is somewhat easy to go from this side, but be careful not to fall because it is quite steep.If you are a normal building from the uphill's groove, please be careful.It is a shop where you can respond to 4 or 5 people as well as 1 person./Until now, the furniture Rajaka, who had only been on the stairs and had no this, was very convenient.The exit of the old man was also staggered by the stairs alone, and the stairs were bent during the stairs, so they seemed to bump into the people coming from the opposite side.Because there is a signal in front of the exit, if you talk on the stairs before the signal, you can see it on the stairs, but it is scattered because you can't cross it, or you become an unborn place on the stairs.The new side exit bends Waseda Street and appears in front of Akagi Shrine, so the distance of the car is less sidewalk, so you can get from the side even if you are looking at the story or map.In the left hand of the escalator, there is a simple map (around the station), making it convenient.Since it is a map of the furniture lazaka's signal, there is a new outlet of escalators and elevators near Akagi Shrine.Ceramic Lee has a long vehicle with 10 cars, but the furniture Lajaka station does not exit only in front and back, and the station is called Yarycho, and it is a little west in the center of the furniture Rajaka..You can enjoy it just by walking.This makes it easier to stroller and wheelchairs.I think it's a geographical relationship, but Yarae -gu has a lot of stairs, so even adults feel sighing when they come on the ground.The elevator may have to be congested.There are a lot of flags/Novori on the street of furniture, so the color of the flag is in the middle of the red and purple color, and the elegant and calm color fits the scenery or emotion of the village.The scenery looks different, rich in emotions, and the atmosphere of anger, but it's an excessive spell.The first person may be embarrassed because the grooves are arranged up and down.The station premises are a bit dark./Tokyo Metro Zay Station. "
3572," Now there are many religious facilities, and it's a delicious stylish street of meals. It is an unexpected history.In fact, it is in Yarycho, but the furniture Lajaka is famous.If you want to go to furniture Lajaka, I think it's good to go to Sakashita in Idabashi.It would be rare to the metro station.In general, what is called ""station"" is difficult to make on the slope.Therefore, there are not many names with the name of the hill.So, the name of this ""furniture Lajaka"" is a rare value.It's not really good. If you don't want to work at the station, if you quit ... "
3573," If the mobility is a problem, please plan properly./ Metro is as unified as possible because the right traffic changes according to the station., Home doors are stuck safer and safer. "

"
3612," I think it's also an ant to see this.I was nicely deceived by JR East Japan Station.The station has two exits, the east and the west, and the history of the east exit looks like an overpass due to the slopes around the station, and the history of the west exit is a cross -station building facing the Ushi Gome Bridge. "
3613,"The station platform is an island platform with one side and two lines.The platform is located on a 300 -meter -wide curve track, so the interval between the train and the platform is large.Therefore, there are many facilities to remind passengers to remind passengers, such as warning lights that rotate in addition to in -vehicle announcements, and many speakers are installed at the platform.In January 2001, a passenger crash from Shin -Okubo Station on Yamanote Line (Passenger Crash from Sinokubo Station) was prepared under the platform.There was a tug of the train that returned from the start of the train.We have announced the reconstruction and improvement of.Reverse Square.The basic design will be held in mid -2014.The temporary historical building was opened on August 7, 2016, and the exit of the old west toward Ugome Bridge was closed.The two -sided home field is not Date./JR's home was relocated near Yotsuya, so the transfer with the subway has become uncomfortable.I, the receptionist?When I listened to the road, I didn't want to teach it, and it was corresponding to the chat.I felt like going somewhere.I feel like a city and I don't want to go back.There are subway ceramics, Oe -do, Yuraku first, and Nanfan Line, and there are many office buildings around Idabashi Higashi Guchi area when they come to the ground."

"
3615," When I had lost an umbrella, I visited the ticket side or went to the parachute center and responded politely.I didn't expect much polite, so I kindly checked or alive with another parallel center.Thank you.The gap with the groove disappeared and the risk of falling was lost.Due to the rapid curve, the enemy was eliminated in Kant, so that it could be safely lifted.The previous groove remains a passage.!/It's okay for myself of a healthy person, but I thought it would be better to maintain more for those who are uncomfortable in the body.I think it's hard, but I think it's hard, but I would like to ask you.Thank you.There are so many humans who ignore the signal.

3738,"There's a rental car nearby, a large park, and a city center.It was good because the old subway underground tunnel and business distance matched.The station has become a variety of uncomfortable making. "
3739," Home is very narrow.There is no gate for safety.The elevator is the only direction of Funagibashi.The escalator is at both entrances, but the staircase is quite a half -half, and there are quite a few stairs on the way, so the barrier -free escalator is not contributing.There is also a rainy place.(As soon as I entered the entrance to Sawakaibashi) "
3740," So I was strict but one star., I feel like there is a store ./ Toy Zay's Kiba. "

3742,"but Except for Commuting Time is a big park named kiba koen,and There are many tested restorant.The elevator can be dense because it rides in a dedicated ticket gate due to the structure.As of 2022, it is hard to say that the station is under construction or clean, and the groove is narrow.Home doors are both Nakano, Nashihu Nabashi.The 4B exit has elevators and escalators, even after the ticket gate, so it is kind to not only people in strollers and wheelchairs but also healthy people.I want to use the elevator well.The security guard is not meaningful because it does not move on the spot just by inducing the mouth.The escalator is partially present.Therefore, it is very difficult to use if the legs are inadequate or have a large amount of luggage.Not only many subways but also the exit to the ticket gate is quite./Sometimes I stop by the relationship.

3743," Recently, large -scale improvement projects are currently underway due to the increase in sugar elevators, and by 2021, there is a significant expansion of Concoses or the expansion of escalators and elevators.It is a connected station, and there is only two entrances.There is an exit that is only the stairs, so the barrier free is delayed.Large -scale water construction is in progress, but it will be improved after that, but it will wait for a quick completion.The station's journal feels too deeply hiding, but the groove of the station is too narrow.The origin of the name of the givea's station is because there was a raceward nearby.There are several shops around the station.There is a giva park near the station./I used the century century, but I feel dissatisfied because the escalator was built just before the final use.
